Thaumaturgy,----- Thaumaturgy -----,,,,,,
Thaumaturgy,The Path of Blood,1,A Taste for Blood,"This power was developed as a means of testing a foe’s might — an extremely important ability in the tumultuous early nights of Clan Tremere. By merely touching the blood of his subject, the caster may de-termine how much vitae remains in the subject and, if the subject is a vampire, how recently he has fed, his approximate Generation and, with three or more suc-cesses, whether he has ever committed diablerie.", The number of successes achieved on the roll determines how much information the thauma-turge gleans and how accurate it is.,V20 Corebook,212
Thaumaturgy,The Path of Blood,2,Blood Rage,"This power allows a vampire to force another Kin-dred to expend blood against his will. The caster must touch her subject for this power to work, though only the lightest contact is necessary. A vampire affected by this power might feel a physical rush as the thau-maturge heightens his Physical Attributes, might find himself suddenly looking more human, or may even find himself on the brink of frenzy as his stores of vitae are mystically depleted."," Each success forces the subject to spend one blood point immediately in the way the caster desires (which must go towards some logical expenditure the target vampire could make, such as increasing Physical Attributes or powering Disciplines). Note that blood points forcibly spent in this manner may exceed the normal “per turn” maximum indicated by the victim’s Generation. Each success gained also increases the subject’s difficulty to resist frenzy by one. The thauma-turge may not use Blood Rage on herself to circumvent generational limits.",V20 Corebook,212
Thaumaturgy,The Path of Blood,3,Blood of Potency,"The thaumaturge gains such control over his own blood that he may effectively “concentrate” it, mak-ing it more powerful for a short time. In effect, he may temporarily lower his own Generation with this power. This power may be used only once per night."," One success on the Willpower roll allows the character to lower his Generation by one step for one hour. Each additional success grants the Kindred either one step down in Generation or one hour of ef-fect. Successes earned must be spent both to decrease the vampire’s Generation and to maintain the change (this power cannot be activated again until the origi-nal application wears off). If the vampire is diablerized while this power is in effect, it wears off immediately and the diablerist gains power appropriate to the cast-er’s actual Generation. Furthermore, any mortals Em-braced by the thaumaturge are born to the Generation appropriate to their sire’s original Generation (e.g., a Tenth-Generation Tremere who has reduced his ef-fective Generation to Eighth still produces Eleventh-Generation childer).Once the effect wears off, any blood over the char-acter’s blood pool maximum dilutes, leaving the char-acter at his regular blood pool maximum. Thus, if a Twelfth-Generation Tremere (maximum blood pool of 11) decreased his Generation to Ninth (maximum blood pool 14), ingested 14 blood points, and had this much vitae in his system when the power wore off, his blood pool would immediately drop to 11.",V20 Corebook,212
Thaumaturgy,The Path of Blood,4,Theft of Vitae,A thaumaturge using this power siphons vitae from her subject. She need never come in contact with the subject — blood literally streams out in a physical tor-rent from the subject to the Kindred (though it is often mystically absorbed and need not enter through the mouth).," The number of successes determines how many blood points the caster transfers from the sub-ject. The subject must be visible to the thaumaturge and within 50 feet (15 meters). Using this power pre-vents the caster from being blood-bound, but other-wise counts as if the vampire ingested the blood her-self. This power is spectacularly obvious, and Camarilla princes justifiably consider its public use a breach of the Masquerade.",V20 Corebook,213
Thaumaturgy,The Path of Blood,5,Cauldron of Blood,"A thaumaturge using this power boils her subject’s blood in his veins like water on a stove. The Kindred must touch her subject, and it is this contact that sim-mers the subject’s blood. This power is always fatal to mortals, and causes great damage to even the mightiest vampires."," The number of successes gained determines how many blood points are brought to boil. The sub-ject suffers one health level of aggravated damage for each point boiled (individuals with Fortitude may soak this damage using only their Fortitude dice). A single success kills any mortal, though some ghouls with ac-cess to Fortitude are said to have survived after soaking all of the aggravated damage.",V20 Corebook,213
Thaumaturgy,Elemental Mastery,1,Elemental Strength,"The vampire can draw upon the strength and resilience
of the earth, or of the objects around him, to increase
his physical prowess without the need for large
amounts of blood."," The player allocates a total of three temporary
bonus dots between the character’s Strength
and Stamina. The number of successes on the roll to
activate the power is the number of turns these dots
remain. The player may spend a Willpower point to
increase this duration by one turn. This power cannot
be “stacked” — one application must expire before the
next can be made.",V20 Corebook,214
Thaumaturgy,Elemental Mastery,2,Wooden Tongues,"A vampire may speak, albeit in limited fashion, with
the spirit of any inanimate object. The conversation
may not be incredibly interesting, as most rocks and
chairs have limited concern for what occurs around
them, but the vampire can get at least a general impression
of what the subject has “experienced.” Note
that events which are significant to a vampire may not
be the same events that interest a lawn gnome."," The number of successes dictates the amount
and relevance of the information that the character receives.
One success may yield a boulder’s memory of a
forest fire, while three may indicate that it remembers
a shadowy figure running past, and five will cause the
rock to relate a precise description of a local Gangrel.",V20 Corebook,214
Thaumaturgy,Elemental Mastery,3,Animate the Unmoving,"Objects affected by this power move as the vampire
using it dictates. An object cannot take an action that
would be completely inconceivable for something with
its form — for instance, a door could not leap from
its hinges and carry someone across a street. However,
seemingly solid objects can become flexible within reason:
Barstools can run with their legs, guns can twist
out of their owners’ hands or fire while holstered, and
humanoid statues can move like normal humans.","This power requires the expenditure of a
Willpower point with less than four successes on the
roll. Each use of this power animates one object no
larger than human-sized; the caster may simultaneously
control a number of animate objects equal to his Intelligence
rating. Objects animated by this power stay
animated as long as they are within the caster’s line of
sight or up to an hour, although the thaumaturge can
take other actions during that time.",V20 Corebook,214
Thaumaturgy,Elemental Mastery,4,Elemental Form,"The vampire can take the shape of any inanimate
object of a mass roughly equal to her own. A desk, a
statue, or a bicycle would be feasible, but a house or a
pen would be beyond this power’s capacity."," The number of successes determines how
completely the character takes the shape she wishes
to counterfeit. At least three successes are required for the character to use her senses or Disciplines while in
her altered form. This power lasts for the remainder of
the night, although the character may return to her
normal form at will.",V20 Corebook,214
Thaumaturgy,Elemental Mastery,5,Summon Elemental,"A vampire may summon one of the traditional spirits
of the elements: a salamander (fire), a sylph (air),
a gnome (earth), or an undine (water). Some thaumaturges
claim to have contacted elemental spirits of
glass, electricity, blood, and even atomic energy, but
such reports remain unconfirmed (even as their authors
are summoned to Vienna for questioning). The
caster may choose what type of elemental he wishes to
summon and command.","The character must be near some quantity
of the classical element corresponding to the spirit
he wishes to invoke. The spirit invoked may or may
not actually follow the caster’s instructions once summoned,
but generally will at least pay rough attention
to what it’s being told to do. The number of successes
gained on the Willpower roll determines the power
level of the elemental.
The elemental has three dots in all Physical and
Mental Attributes. One dot may be added to one of
the elemental’s Physical Attributes for each success
gained by the caster on the initial roll. The Storyteller
should determine the elemental’s Abilities, attacks,
and damage, and any special powers it has related to
its element.
Once the elemental has been summoned, the thaumaturge
must exert control over it. The more powerful
the elemental, the more difficult a task this is. The
player rolls Manipulation + Occult (difficulty of the
number of successes scored on the casting roll + 4),
and the number of successes determines the degree of
control:
Successes Result
Botch The elemental immediately attacks
the thaumaturge.
Failure The elemental goes free and may
attack anyone or leave the scene
at the Storyteller’s discretion.
1 success The elemental does not attack its
summoner.
2 successes The elemental behaves favorably
toward the summoner and may
perform a service in exchange forpayment (determined by the
Storyteller).
3 successes The elemental performs one service,
within reason.
4 successes The elemental performs any one task
for the caster that does not jeopardize
its own existence.
5 successes The elemental performs any task that
the caster sets for it, even one that
may take several nights to complete
or that places its existence at risk. payment (determined by the
Storyteller).
3 successes The elemental performs one service,
within reason.

for the caster that does not jeopardize
its own existence.
5 successes The elemental performs any task that
the caster sets for it, even one that
may take several nights to complete
or that places its existence at risk.",V20 Corebook,215
Thaumaturgy,The Green Path,1,"Herbal Wisdom
","With a touch, a vampire can commune with the
spirit of a plant. Conversations held in this manner are
often cryptic but rewarding — the wisdom and experience
of the spirits of some trees surpasses that of the
oracles of legend. Crabgrass, on the other hand, rarely
has much insight to offer, but might reveal the appearance
of the last person who trod upon it."," The number of successes rolled determines
the amount of information that can be gained from the
contact. Depending on the precise information that
the vampire seeks, the Storyteller might require the
player to roll Intelligence + Occult in order to interpret
the results of the communication.
Successes Result
1 success Fleeting cryptic impressions
2 successes One or two clear images
3 successes A concise answer to a simple query
4 successes A detailed response to one or more
complex questions
5 successes The sum total of the plant-spirit’s
knowledge on a given subject ",V20 Corebook,215
Thaumaturgy,The Green Path,2,Speed the Seasons Passing,"This power allows a thaumaturge to accelerate a plant’s
growth, causing roses to bloom in a matter of minutes or
trees to shoot up from saplings overnight. Alternately,
she can speed a plant’s death and decay, withering grass
and crumbling wooden stakes with but a touch.","The character touches the target plant. The
player rolls normally, and the number of successes determines
the amount of growth or decay. One success
gives the plant a brief growth spurt or simulates the effects
of harsh weather, while three noticeably enlarge
or wither it. With five successes, a full-grown plant
springs from a seed or crumbles to dust in a few minutes,
and a tree sprouts fruit or begins decaying almost
instantaneously. If this power is used in combat, three
successes are needed to render a wooden weapon completely
useless. Two successes suffice to weaken it, while
five cause it to disintegrate in the wielder’s hand.",V20 Corebook,216
Thaumaturgy,The Green Path,3,Dance of Vines,"The thaumaturge can animate a mass of vegetation
up to his own size, using it for utilitarian or combat purposes
with equal ease. Leaves can walk along a desktop,
ivy can act as a scribe, and jungle creepers can strangle
opponents. Intruders should beware of Tremere workshops
that harbor potted rowan saplings."," Any total amount of vegetation with a mass
less than or equal to the character’s own may be animated
through this power. The plants stay active for one turn
per success scored on the roll, and are under the complete
control of the character. If used for combat purposes, the
plants have Strength and Dexterity ratings each equal
to half the character’s Willpower (rounded down) and
Brawl ratings one lower than that of the character.
Dance of Vines cannot make plants uproot themselves
and go stomping about. Even the most energetic
vegetation is incapable of pulling out of the soil and
walking under the effect of this power. However, 200
pounds (100 kilograms) of kudzu can cover a considerable
area all by itself….",V20 Corebook,216
Thaumaturgy,The Green Path,4,Verdant Haven,"This power weaves a temporary shelter out of a sufficient
amount of plant matter. In addition to providing physical
protection from the elements (and even sunlight), the
Verdant Haven also establishes a mystical barrier which
is nearly impassable to anyone the caster wishes to exclude.
A Verdant Haven appears as a six-foot-tall (twometer-
tall) hemisphere of interlocked branches, leaves, and vines with no discernible opening, and even to the
casual observer it appears to be an unnatural construction.
Verdant Havens are rumored to have supernatural
healing properties, hut no Kindred have reported experiencing
such benefits from a stay in one."," A character must be standing in a heavily
vegetated area to use this power. The Verdant Haven
springs up around the character over the course of three
turns. Once the haven is established, anyone wishing
to enter the haven without the caster’s permission
must achieve more than the caster’s original number of
successes on a single roll of Wits + Survival (difficulty
equal to the caster’s Willpower). The haven lasts until
the next sunset, or until the caster dispels or leaves it.
If the caster scored four or more successes, the haven is
impenetrable to sunlight unless physically breached.",V20 Corebook,216
Thaumaturgy,The Green Path,5,Awaken the Forest Giants,"Entire trees can be animated by a master of the
Green Path. Ancient oaks can be temporarily given
the gift of movement, pulling their roots from the soil
and shaking the ground with their steps. While not as
versatile as elementals or other summoned spirits, trees
brought to ponderous life via this power display awesome
strength and resilience."," The character touches the tree to be animated.
The player spends a blood point and rolls normally.
If the roll succeeds, the player must spend a blood
point for every success. The tree stays animated for one
turn per success rolled; once this time expires, the tree
puts its roots down wherever it stands and cannot be
animated again until the next night. While animated,
the tree follows the character’s verbal commands to
the best of its ability. An animated tree has Strength
and Stamina equal to the caster’s Thaumaturgy rating,
Dexterity 2, and a Brawl rating equal to the caster’s
own. It is immune to bashing damage, and all lethal
damage dice pools are halved due to its size.
Once the animating energy leaves a tree, it puts
down roots immediately, regardless of what it is currently
standing on. A tree re-establishing itself in the
soil can punch through concrete and asphalt to find
nourishing dirt and water underneath, meaning that it
is entirely possible for a sycamore to root itself in the
middle of a road without any warning.",V20 Corebook,217
Thaumaturgy,Hands of Destruction,1,Decay,"This power accelerates the decrepitude of its target,
causing it to wither, rot, or otherwise break down. The
target must be inanimate, though dead organic matter
can be affected."," If the roll is successful, the inanimate object
touched by the thaumaturge ages 10 years for every
minute the Kindred touches it. If the vampire breaks
physical contact and wishes to age the object again,
another blood point must be spent and another roll
must be made. This power does not affect vampires.",V20 Corebook,217
Thaumaturgy,Hands of Destruction,2,Gnarl Wood,"This power warps and bends wooden objects.
Though the wood is otherwise undamaged, this power
often leaves the objects completely useless. This power
may also be used to swell or contract wood, in addition
to bending it into unwholesome shapes. Unlike
other powers of this path, Gnarl Wood requires merely
a glance rather than physical contact."," Fifty pounds or twenty-five kilograms of visible
wood may be gnarled for each blood point spent
on this power (the thaumaturge may expend as much
blood as she likes on this power, up to her per-turn
generational maximum). It is also possible to warp
multiple visible objects — like all the stakes a team of
vampire-hunters wields.",V20 Corebook,217
Thaumaturgy,Hands of Destruction,3,Acidic Touch,"The vampire secretes a bilious, acidic fluid from any
portion of his body. The viscous acid corrodes metal,
destroys wood, and causes horrendous chemical burns
to living tissue.","The player spends one blood point to create
the acid — the blood literally transmutes into the volatile
secretion. One blood point creates enough acid to
burn through a quarter-inch or half a centimeter of steel
plate or three inches (seven centimeters) of wood. The
damage from an acid-augmented hand-to-hand attack
is aggravated and costs one blood point per turn to use.
A thaumaturge is immune to her own acidic touch.",V20 Corebook,217
Thaumaturgy,Hands of Destruction,4,Atrophy,"This power withers a victim’s limb, leaving only a desiccated,
almost mummified husk of bone and skin. The effects
are instantaneous; in mortals, they are also irreversible."," The victim may resist the effects of Atrophy
by scoring three or more successes on a Stamina + Athletics
roll (difficulty 8). Failure means the limb is permanently
and completely crippled. Partial resistance
is possible: One success indicates that the difficulty of
any roll involving the use of the arm increases by two,
though these effects are still permanent with regard to
mortals. Two successes signify that difficulties increase
by one. Vampires afflicted by this power may spend five
blood points to rejuvenate atrophied limbs. Mortals are
permanently crippled. This power affects only limbs or
parts of limbs (arms, legs, hands); it does not work on
victims’ heads, torsos, etc.",V20 Corebook,217
Thaumaturgy,Hands of Destruction,5,Turn to Dust,"This fearsome power accelerates decrepitude in its
victims. Mortals literally age at the mere touch of a
skilled thaumaturge, gaining decades in moments."," Each success on the roll ages the victim by
10 years. A potential victim may resist with a Stamina
+ Courage roll (difficulty 8), but must accumulate
more successes than the caster’s activation roll — it’s
an all-or-nothing affair. If the victim succeeds, he does
not age at all. If he does not acquire more successes
than the thaumaturge, he ages the full amount. Obviously,
this power, while it affects vampires, has no detrimental
effect on them (they’re immortal). At most, a
Kindred victim grows paler and withers slightly (-1 to
Appearance) for one night.",V20 Corebook,218
Thaumaturgy,Neptune's Might,1,Eyes of the Sea,"The thaumaturge may peer into a body of water and
view events that have transpired on, in, or around it
from the water’s perspective. Some older practitioners
of this art claim that the vampire communes with the
spirits of the waters when using this power; younger
Kindred scoff at such claims."," The number of successes rolled determines
how far into the past the character can look.
Successes Result
1 success One day
2 successes One week
3 successes One month
4 successes One year
5 successes 10 years
The Storyteller may require a Perception + Occult
roll for the character to discern very small details in the
transmitted images. This power can only he used on
standing water; lakes and puddles qualify, but oceans,
rivers, sewers, and wine glasses do not.",V20 Corebook,219
Thaumaturgy,Neptune's Might,2,Prison of Water,"The thaumaturge can command a sufficiently large
quantity of water to animate itself and imprison a subject.
This power requires a significant amount of fluid
to be fully effective, although even a few gallons can be
used to shape chains of animated water."," The number of successes scored on the roll
is the number of successes the victim must score on a
Strength roll (difficulty 8; Potence can add to this roll)
to break free. A subject may be held in only one prison
at a time, although the caster is free to invoke multiple
uses of this power upon separate victims and may dissolve
these prisons at will. If a sufficient quantity of
water (at least a bathtub’s worth) is not present, the
difficulty of the Willpower roll to activate this power
is raised by one.",V20 Corebook,219
Thaumaturgy,Neptune's Might,3,Blood to Water,"The thaumaturge has now attained enough power
over water that she can transmute other liquids to this
basic element. The most commonly seen use of this
power is as an assault; with but a touch, the victim’s
blood transforms to water, weakening vampires and
killing mortals in moments."," The character must touch her intended victim.
The player rolls Willpower normally. Each success
converts one of the victim’s blood points to water. One
success kills a mortal within minutes. Vampires who
lose blood points to this power also suffer dice pool
penalties as if they had received an equivalent number
of health levels of injury. The water left in the target’s
system by this attack evaporates out at a rate of one
blood point’s worth per hour, but the lost blood does
not return.
At the Storyteller’s discretion, other liquids may be
turned to water with this power (the difficulty for such
an action is reduced by one unless the substance is particularly
dangerous or magical in nature). The character
must still touch the substance or its container to use
this power.",V20 Corebook,219
Thaumaturgy,Neptune's Might,4,Flowing Wall,"Tales of vampires’ inability to cross running water
may have derived in part from garbled accounts of this
power in action. The thaumaturge can animate water
to an even greater degree than is possible with the use
of Prison of Water, commanding it to rise up to form a
barrier impassable to almost any being."," The character touches the surface of a
standing body of water; the player spends three Willpower
points and the normal required blood point and
rolls normally. Successes are applied to both width and
height of the wall; each success “buys” 10 feet/three
meters in one dimension. The wall may be placed anywhere
within the character’s line of sight, and must be
formed in a straight line. The wall lasts until the next
sunrise. It cannot be climbed, though it can be flown
over. To pass through the barrier, any supernatural being
(including beings trying to pass the wall on other
levels of existence, such as ghosts) must score at least
three successes on a single Willpower roll (difficulty
9).",V20 Corebook,219
Thaumaturgy,Neptune's Might,5,Dehydrate,"At this level of mastery, the thaumaturge can directly
attack living and unliving targets by removing the
water from their bodies. Victims killed by this power
leave behind hideous mummified corpses. This power
can also be used for less aggressive purposes, such as
drying out wet clothes — or evaporating puddles to
keep other practitioners of this path from using them."," This power can be used on any target in the
character’s line of sight. The player rolls normally; the
victim resists with a roll of Stamina + Fortitude (difficulty
9). Each success gained by the caster translates
into one health level of lethal damage inflicted on the
victim. This injury cannot be soaked (the resistance
roll replaces soak for this attack) but can be healed
normally. Vampires lose blood points instead of health
levels, though if a vampire has no blood points this attack
inflicts health level loss as it would against a mortal.
The victim of this attack must also roll Courage
(difficulty equal to the number of successes scored by
the caster + 3) to be able to act on the turn following
the attack; failure means he is overcome with agony
and can do nothing.",V20 Corebook,219
Thaumaturgy,The Path of Conjuring,1,Summon the Simple Form,"At this level of mastery, the conjurer may create
simple, inanimate objects. The object cannot have any
moving parts and may not be made of multiple materials.
For example, the conjurer may summon a steel
baton, a lead pipe, a wooden stake, or a chunk of granite."," Each turn the conjurer wishes to keep the
object in existence, another Willpower point must be
spent or the object vanishes.",V20 Corebook,221
Thaumaturgy,The Path of Conjuring,2,Permanency,"At this level, the conjurer no longer needs to pay
Willpower costs to keep an object in existence. The
object is permanent, though simple objects are still all
that may be created."," The player must invest three blood points
in an object to make it real.",V20 Corebook,221
Thaumaturgy,The Path of Conjuring,3,Magic of the Smith,"The Kindred may now conjure complex objects of
multiple components and with moving parts. For example,
the thaumaturge can create guns, bicycles,
chainsaws, or cellphones."," Objects created via Magic of the Smith are
automatically permanent and cost five blood points
to conjure. Particularly complex items often require a
Knowledge roll (Crafts, Science, Technology, etc.) in
addition to the basic roll.",V20 Corebook,221
Thaumaturgy,The Path of Conjuring,4,Reverse Conjuration,"This power allows the conjurer to “banish” into nonexistence
any object previously called forth via this
path."," This is an extended success roll. The conjurer
must accumulate as many successes as the original
caster received when creating the object in question.
This can also be used by the thaumaturge to banish
object she created herself with this Path.",V20 Corebook,221
Thaumaturgy,The Path of Conjuring,5,Power Over Life,"This power cannot create true life, though it can
summon forth impressive simulacra. Creatures (and
people) summoned with this power lack the free will
to act on their own, mindlessly following the simple
instructions of their conjurer instead. People created
in this way can be subject to the use of the Dominate
power Possession (p. 155), if desired."," The player spends 10 blood points. Imperfect
and impermanent, creatures summoned via this
path are too complex to exist for long. Within a week
after their conjuration, the simulacra vanish into insubstantiality.",V20 Corebook,221
Thaumaturgy,The Path of Corruption,1,Contradict,"The vampire can interrupt a subject’s thought processes,
forcing the victim to reverse his current course
of action. An Archon may be caused to execute a prisoner
she was about to exonerate and release; a mortal
lover might switch from gentle and caring to sadistic
and demanding in the middle of an encounter. The results
of Contradict are never precisely known to the
thaumaturge in advance, but they always take the form
of a more negative action than the subject had originally
intended to perform."," This power may be used on any subject
within the character’s line of sight. The player rolls as
per normal. The target rolls Perception + Subterfuge
(difficulty equal to the number of successes scored by
the caster + 2). Two successes allow the subject to realize that she is being influenced by some outside source.
Three successes let her pinpoint the source of the effect.
Four successes give her a moment of hesitation,
neither performing her original action nor its inverse,
while five allow her to carry through with the original
action.
The Storyteller dictates what the subject’s precise
reaction to this power is. Contradict cannot be used in
combat or to affect other actions (at the Storyteller’s
discretion) that are mainly physical and reflexive.",V20 Corebook,221
Thaumaturgy,The Path of Corruption,2,Subvert,"This power follows the same principle as does Contradict,
the release of a subject’s dark, self-destructive
side. However, Subvert’s effects are longer-lasting than
the momentary flare of Contradiction. Under the influence
of this power, victims act on their own suppressed
temptations, pursuing agendas that their morals
or self-control would forbid them to follow under
normal circumstances."," This power requires the character to make
eye contact (see p. 152) with the intended victim. The
player rolls normally. The target resists with a roll of
Perception + Subterfuge (difficulty equal to the target’s
Manipulation + Subterfuge). If the thaumaturge scores
more successes, the victim becomes inclined to follow
a repressed, shameful desire for the length of time described
below.
Successes Result
1 success Five minutes
2 successes One hour
3 successes One night
4 successes Three nights
5 successes One week
The Storyteller determines the precise desire or
agenda that the victim follows. It should be in keeping
with the Psychological Flaws that she possesses or
with the negative aspects of her Nature (for example,
a Loner desiring isolation to such an extent that she
becomes violent if forced to attend a social function).
The subject should not become fixated on following
this new agenda at all times, but should occasionally be
forced to spend a Willpower point if the opportunity to
succumb arises and she wishes to resist the impulse.",V20 Corebook,222
Thaumaturgy,The Path of Corruption,3,Dissociate,"“Divide and conquer” is a maxim that is well-understood
by the Tremere, and Dissociate is a powerful tool
with which to divide the Clan’s enemies. This power
is used to break the social ties of interpersonal relationships.
Even the most passionate affair or the oldest
friendship can be cooled through use of Dissociate, and
weaker personal ties can be destroyed altogether."," The character must touch the target. The
player rolls normally. The target resists with a Willpower
roll (difficulty of the thaumaturge’s Manipulation
+ Empathy). The victim loses three dice from
all Social rolls for a period of time determined by the
number of successes gained by the caster:
Successes Result
1 success Five minutes
2 successes One hour
3 successes One night
4 successes Three nights
5 successes One week
This penalty applies to all rolls that rely on Social
Attributes, even those required for the use of Disciplines.
If this power is used on a character who has
participated in the Vaulderie or a similar ritual, that
character’s Vinculum ratings are reduced by three for
the duration of Dissociate’s effect.
Dissociate’s primary effect falls under roleplaying
rather than game mechanics. Victims of this power
should be played as withdrawn, suspicious, and emotionally
distant. The Storyteller should feel free to require
a Willpower point expenditure for a player who
does not follow these guidelines.",V20 Corebook,223
Thaumaturgy,The Path of Corruption,4,Addiction,"This power is a much stronger and more potentially
damaging form of Subvert. Addiction creates just that
in the victim. By simply exposing the target to a particular
sensation, substance, or action, the caster creates
a powerful psychological dependence. Many thaumaturges
ensure that their victims become addicted to
substances or thrills that only the mystic can provide,
thus creating both a source of income and potential
blackmail material."," The subject must encounter or be exposed
to the sensation, substance, or action to which the
character wants to addict him. The thaumaturge then
touches his target. The player rolls normally; the victim
resists with a Self-Control/Instinct roll (difficulty
equal to the number of successes scored by the caster
+ 3). Failure gives the subject an instant addiction to
that object.
An addicted character must get his fix at least once
a night. Every night that he goes without satisfying his
desire imposes a cumulative penalty of one die on all of
his dice pools (to a minimum pool of one die). The victim
must roll Self-Control/Instinct (difficulty 8) every
time he is confronted with the object of his addiction
and wishes to keep from indulging. Addiction lasts for
a number of weeks equal to the thaumaturge’s Manipulation
score.
An individual may try to break the effects of Addiction.
This requires an extended Self-Control/Instinct
roll (difficulty of the caster’s Manipulation + Subterfuge),
with one roll made per night. The addict must
accumulate a number of successes equal to three times
the number of successes scored by the caster. The victim
may not indulge in his addiction over the time
needed to accumulate these successes. If he does so, all
accumulated successes are lost and he must begin anew
on the next night. Note that the Self-Control/Instinct
dice pool is reduced every night that the victim goes
without feeding his addiction.",V20 Corebook,223
Thaumaturgy,The Path of Corruption,5,Dependence,"Many former pawns of Clan Tremere claim to have
felt a strange sensation similar to depression when not
in the presence of their masters. This is usually attributed
to the blood bond, but is sometimes the result of
the vampire’s mastery of Dependence. The final power
of the Path of Corruption enables the vampire to tie
her victim’s soul to her own, engendering feelings of
lethargy and helplessness when the victim is not in her
presence or acting to further her desires."," The character engages the target in conversation.
The player rolls normally. The victim rolls
Self-Control/Instinct (difficulty equals the number of
successes scored by the caster + 3). Failure means that
the victim’s psyche has been subtly bonded to that of
the thaumaturge for one night per success rolled by the
caster.
A bonded victim is no less likely to attack his controller,
and feels no particular positive emotions toward
her. However, he is psychologically addicted to
her presence, and suffers a one-die penalty to all rolls
when he is not around her or performing tasks for her. Additionally, he is much less resistant to her commands,
and his dice pools are halved when he attempts
to resist her Dominate, Presence (or other mental or
emotional control powers), or mundane Social rolls.
Finally, he is unable to regain Willpower when he is
not in the thaumaturge’s presence.",V20 Corebook,223

Technomancy power on the devices with which she
makes contact."," The character touches any form of communications
device: a cellphone, 3G-equipped netbook,
Wi-Fi tablet, or anything else that is connected directly
or indirectly to the Internet. The player rolls normally
and spends a Willpower point. Telecommute lasts for
five minutes per success rolled, and may be extended by
10 minutes with the expenditure of another Willpower
point. The number of successes indicates the maximum
range that the character can project her consciousness
away from her body:

2 successes  250 miles/400 kilometers
3 successes  1000 miles/1500 kilometers

While in the network, the character can apply any
other Path of Technomancy power to any device or
data with which she comes in contact. A loss of connection,
either through the destruction of a part of the
network or simply a loss of cell signal, hurls her consciousness
back to her body and inflicts eight dice of

Caine to her as he fled his wife’s spurning. Hideously
ugly, the crone had to resort to trickery to get others to
help or serve her."," This power reduces the target’s Appearance
to zero. All Social rolls during this time generally fail,

the subject. This power lasts for one night.",V20 Corebook,227
Thaumaturgy,The Path of the Father's Vengeance,3,Feast of Ashes,"Primarily used against wanton or excessive vampires,
this power temporarily removes a vampire’s dependency
on blood. While some would say this negates the
Curse of Caine, it reduces the vampire to little more
than a wretched scavenger, as he must consume literal
ashes, though he gains little sustenance from them."," The victim of this power can no longer consume
blood, vomiting it up as he would mortal food or
drink. Instead, the victim can eat only ashes, and the
“blood points” he gains from this may be used only to
rise each night. Ashen “blood points” may not be used
to power Disciplines, raise Attributes, or feed ghouls
(though actual blood points in the character’s body at
the time this power is invoked may still be used for
such). One blood point’s worth of ash is roughly one
pint or half-liter, and any ash will do — cigarette ash,
campfire leftovers, or vampire corpses destroyed by fire

Death. All but the dimmest of light causes the subject
excruciating pain, and some artificial forms of bright
light may even damage the vampire. Uriel delivered
God’s curse on Caine, shielding him in the blackness
of his wings."," The presence of any light makes the subject
uncomfortable, and bright light of any kind — flashlights, 
headlights, etc. — inflict one health level of aggravated
damage on the character for every turn he remains
under its direct focus. Most vampires who suffer
this curse elect to sleep for the duration, hiding away in
the darkness of their havens until they can walk again
among the living without pain. This power lasts for
one week.",V20 Corebook,227
Thaumaturgy,The Path of the Father's Vengeance,5,Valediction,"Many Sabbat rightfully fear this power, though very
few have ever seen it used. It levies a punishment for
breaking one of Caine’s greatest commandments —
the ban against diablerie. As most Sabbat attain their
power and station through some measure of diablerie,
they must reconcile their beliefs with the admonitions
of Caine, and this power engenders a great sense of humility."," When this power takes effect, the subject
immediately reverts to her original Generation. This
change may entail losing points in certain Traits due to
generational maximums. This power lasts for one week,
after which any Traits reduced to higher-Generation
maximums return to normal. It takes three turns to spea",V20 Corebook,228

this power may change depending on the current local weather conditions and the weather the character is attempting to create.

• Fog: Vision is slightly impaired and sounds are muffled; a +1 difficulty is imposed on all Perception rolls that involve sight and hearing, and the effective range of all ranged attacks are halved. Light breeze: A +1 difficulty is
imposed on all Perception rolls that involve smell.
Minor temperature change: It is possible to raise or lower the local temperature by up to 10 degrees Fahrenheit or 5 degrees Celsius.
•• Rain or snow: As Fog, but Perception rolls are impaired to a much greater extent; the difficulty modifier for all such rolls rises to +2. In addition, the difficulty on all Drive rolls increases by two.
••• High Winds: The wind speed rises to around 30 miles per hour or 50 kilometers per hour, with gusts of up to twice that. Ranged attacks are much more difficult: + 1 to firearm attacks and +2 to thrown weapons and archery. In addition, during fierce gusts, Dexterity rolls (difficulty 6) may be required to keep characters from being knocked over by the winds. When gale-force winds are in effect, papers go flying, objects get picked up by the winds and hurled with abandon, and other suitably cinematic effects are likely. 
Moderate temperature change: The local temperature can be raised or lowered by up to 20 degrees Fahrenheit or 10 degrees Celsius.
•••• Storm: This has the effects of both Rain and High Winds.
••••• Lightning Strike: This attack inflicts 10 dice of lethal damage. Body armor does not add to the target’s dice pool to soak this attack.",V20 Corebook,228
Thaumaturgy,Mastery of the Mortal Shell,1,Vertigo,"The thaumaturge induces minor disorientation
and dizziness through subtle manipulations in the
subject's body. The physical discomfort is temporary
and minor, but a clever thaumaturge can use it on rivals
at the most inopportune times, causing them to
lose their aplomb.","A touch from the thaumaurge invokes
disorientation in he vicim. If successful,
all of he victim's physical actions are at
+1 difficulty for he duration of the power.
Subsequent uses of this Patth may extend
the duration, though the difficulty will not 
increase further.",Rites of the Blood,138
Thaumaturgy,Mastery of the Mortal Shell,2,Contortion,"With a touch, the thaumaturge causes a group
of her opponent's muscles to contract involuntarily,
reducing it to twitching fits. This effect is extremely
disconcerting to the subject, rendering the limb
or muscle group unusable.","By making physical contact with one of
the limbs of the target, the thaumaturge
renders it useless for the duration of Contortion.
A leg rendered useless makes standing difficult,
and the victim suffers from increased difficulty 
(+1 to +3, depending on circumstances) to
appropriate dexterity challenges related to her leg,
such as dancing or balancing on ledges. A contorted arm
 hangs lifeless at the subject's side. A useless head causes
speech and increases the difficulty of all Social rolls by 2 as
the facial muscles spasm out of control.",Rites of the Blood,138
Thaumaturgy,Mastery of the Mortal Shell,3,Seizure,"Seizure causes the body to erupt into a fit
of convulsions. All the muscles throughout
the body tighten uncontrollably, while the
victim foams at the mouth and spasms rack
him with agony. A mortal may even choke to
death as her tongue cuts off her air supply.","A light touch from the thaumaturge forces the very
unpleasant effects of this power upon the target.
For the duration of the seizure, a target's body writhes,
tormenting her to the point of incapacitation. Victims
suffer a +2 difficulty penalty to all physical actions. The
victim also suffers one level of bashing damage every 
turn, as her body helplessly twists itself. At the Storyteller 
discretion, the effects of this power may even cause 
deatth in extremely ill or wounded mortals.
Damage may be reduced as normal (alhough levels from
armor do not apply.)",Rites of the Blood,138
Thaumaturgy,Mastery of the Mortal Shell,4,Body Failure,"Thaumaturges wielding this frightful power gain
devastating insights into the workings of the body, 
allowing a complete shutdown of its system. This 
sudden biological overload often proves fatal to 
morttals and damaging to other supernatural beings. 
Body Failure has been used throughout the ages to 
afflict horrific ailments in inconspicuous ways that 
suggest a stroke or heart attack.","The thaumaturge no longer needs to touch
her victim to strike out with this level of mastery of the
Path. She may affect any target wihin her line of sight, 
but she must keep visual contactt with the victim at all 
times to maintain this effect. A succesful activation of 
this power grants effects similar to Seizure, except that 
damage is lethal (and thus not soakable by mortals) due 
to complete mass tissue and organ failure. Additionally, 
tthe victim suffers a +2 difficulty penalty to all actions. 
The subject may resist the effects of Body Failure via a
Stamina + Fortitude roll when the thaumaturge attempts
to strike the target (difficulty equals the thaumaturge's
current Willpower). Each success the victim gains on this 
roll reduces the duration of Body Failure by one turn.",Rites of the Blood,138-139
Thaumaturgy,Mastery of the Mortal Shell,5,Marionette,"The thaumaturge invoking Marionette gains such 
mastery over the body of others that she can magically 
seize control of another being and force her victim to act 
according to her own whims. This control is not as fine as 
the direct and personal command of the Dominate Power 
of Possession, but the thaumaturge's true body is not as 
vulnerable during the manipulation. Once established, 
the Marionette victim is under the complete sway of the 
thaumaturge, forced to perform as the thaumaturge's 
macabre pawn.","The thaumaturge may affect any target within 
her line of sight, but must keep visual contact with 
the victim at all times to maintain this effect. A subject 
may resist the effects of Marionette on a Stamina + 
Fortitude roll (difficulty equal to the thaumaturge's 
current Willpower) when the thaumaturge attempts to 
take control. Each success the victim gains on this roll 
reduces the duration of Marionette by one turn. Victims 
lacking Fortitude do not have the physical resistance to 
defy this effect. 
For the duration of this power, thte thaumaturge 
can cause the victim to perform any physical action, 
using the target's pools with a penalty of +2 difficulty 
to all rolls. The concentration this power requires also 
increases the thaumaurge's own difficulties by two for all other personal actions undertaken while manipulating the victim. To extend the duration of this control, 
the thaumaturge must make a second activation roll. 
Marionette does not rob the victim of her cognizance, 
only physical control over her body. During this time 
of thaumaturge's mastery, the target remains aware 
that some outside force is manipulating her physical actions, 
conscious that they are not her own. The victim may 
spend a point of Willpower to attempt to take a mental 
or social action, such as activating a Discipline or 
speaking.",Rites of the Blood,139
Thaumaturgy,Path of the Focused Mind,1,Readiness,"Using Readiness makes the caster able to gain a quicker 
understanding of a predicament. Enhanced lucidity 
enlightens the caster, allowing increased cleverness and 
better reactions to changing situations.","This power is only usable on the thaumaturge 
herself. Every success on the activation roll adds on die 
to a special dice pool for the remainder of the turn. These 
dice may be used on any Wits-related rolls or actions that 
the thaumaturge performs during this turn. Alternatively, 
each die removed from the dice pool adds one to the 
caster's initiative rating. ",Rites of the Blood,139
Thaumaturgy,Path of the Focused Mind,2,Centering,"By invoking this power, the thaumaturge causes a 
sudden, intense calmness in the subject by whispering 
soothing words to her. While under this serenity, the 
target is better able to focus on tasks at hand, ignoring 
distractions and annoyances, including grave bodily harm. 
Thaumaturges in fear of frenzy often use this power on 
themselves to stifle their own emotions and achieve a 
state of tranquility.","This power is usable on any one subject within 
earshot of the thaumaturge and lasts for one turn per 
success on the activation roll. During this period, the 
target is unaffected by any power or effect (with the 
notable exception of Elder disciplines) that reduces her 
dice pools. This includes wound penalties, situational 
modifiers, and Disciplines. Modifications to difficulty 
numbers still apply during this time, however. In addition, 
due to the unnatural serenity that this power bestows, 
the target receives two additional dice in all attempts to 
avoid or break frenzy.",Rites of the Blood,139-140
Thaumaturgy,Path of the Focused Mind,3,One-Tracked Mind,"By extending her powers to other individuals, the 
thaumaturge is able to fixate the subject on one action. 
This single-mindedness of the target is so complete 
that they ignore everything else that occurs around 
them. Guards are easily distracted with this power, as 
their attention becomes fixated elsewhere, and research 
becomes a dedicated, focused task. Use of this power 
is sometimes colloquially referred tto as ""railroading 
someone.""","This power may affect anyone who can hear 
the thaumaturge. Succesful invocation makes the target 
unable to split any dice pools for multiple actions and 
unable to change tactics after actions have been declared. 
As a side benefit, the target reduces tthe difficulty of the 
declared action by one. Additional actions that the victim 
takes (from Celeritty, for example) during the duration 
of this power must follow up upon their initial action, 
as they concentrate wholly upon this one idea. If the 
target wishes to attempt a different course of action, 
she must spend a point of Willpower per scene (or per 
turn in combat.) The duration of One-Tracked Mind is 
one scene, or one turn per success on the activation roll.",Rites of the Blood,140
Thaumaturgy,Path of the Focused Mind,4,Dual Thought,"The rigors of learning Thaumaturgy strengthen the 
mind and the will of a thaumaturge. As a result, those 
skilled with Thaumaturgy often have the ability to quickly 
assess a situation and calculate the options available to 
them. At this level of mastery of the Focused Mind, 
the thaumaturge is able to divide her attention to two 
completely seperate tasks without penalty or distraction. 
As One-Tracked Mind forces the subject's attenttion into a 
single objecttive, Dual Thought expands the thaumaturge's 
concentration to the point that focus upon two goals is possible.","Succesful use of Dual Thought allow the 
caster to take two actions without penalty during her turn. 
(Note that this power specifically lifts the restrictions of 
multiple actions detailed in V20, P. 248). The extra action 
granted by this power must be a mental action, whether 
it's the use of Disciplines such as the use of Auspex or 
Thaumaturgy, or the contemplation of some problem.
If the character is using both actions to solve a problem, 
she has two seperate dice pools to draw from. These two 
actions happen at the same time, as determined by the 
initiative rating of the character. You may not use the 
extra action to re-cast Dual Thought.",Rites of the Blood,140
Thaumaturgy,Path of the Focused Mind,5,Perfect Clarity,"Perfect Clarity brings about a Zen-like moment of 
focused insight for the thaumaturge as she gains a brief, 
perfect understanding of herself, the universe, and her 
place within it. This lucidity protects the thaumaturge 
from influences both internal and external; even the
Beast within is unable to rage forth. Thought and action 
become one as a complete serenity of the mind descends 
upon the thaumaturge.","Perfect Clarity lasts for the duration of one 
scene, (or one turn plus an additional turn for every 
success on the activation roll if used while in combat). 
For this period, the thaumaturge has the difficulties of 
all actions reduced by two. The Kindred is immune to 
frenzy and Rotschreck from all sources, even supernatural 
triggers. Finally, any means to control or influence the 
thaumaturge suffer a +2 difficulty, including powers such 
as Presence, Dominate, and Dementation.",Rites of the Blood,140
Thaumaturgy,Path of Levinbolt,1,Flicker,"Novice Thaumaturges learn to freely absorb power
around them through electrical outlets, circuits, or 
batteries. A user of this power can sense the current 
feeding into a specific electrical system and then draw
it to her, effectively turning it off.","The thaumaturge simply glances at a target 
powered by electricity. Upon a succesful activation 
roll, she can shut down an electrical device for ten 
minutes per success on the activation roll. The spark 
of electricity arcs from the device directly into the 
thaumaturge in a frightening display of mystical power. 
The source of this power is immediately known.",Rites of the Blood,141
Thaumaturgy,Path of Levinbolt,2,Spark,"Novice thaumaturges can build up a tiny static 
charge, enough to make a noticeable snap with a 
touch. Such a discharge poses little threat to healthy 
targets, though the energy can ruin delicae electronics 
or stun an unlucky victim.","The thaumaturge simply touches a target 
(after the requisite blood expenditure and activation 
roll by the player) and releases the spark. The 
electricity can snap from any part of the caster's body, 
so a thaumaturge might give an unpleasant surprise
to someone touching her. The resulting electrical 
discharge inflicts four dice of lethal damage to targets
(difficulty 7 to soak), and short-circuits electronic 
equipment and devices not specifically grounded 
against lightning strike.
",Rites of the Blood,141
Thaumaturgy,Path of Levinbolt,3,Illuminate,"Neonates sometimes derogatively refer to this effect
as the ""40-watt Tremere,"" right up until they've felt its
sting. The thaumaturge summons enough electricity 
to cover her hand or arm in arcing bolts. This power 
can charge a battery, briefly run a small device, or 
even leave a nasty burn on a touched subject.","Each success scored on the player's 
activation roll translates to approximately one turn of 
power sufficient to run a handful of lights or a small 
electrical device. Alternately, the thaumaturge can 
shock someone by touch, as with the Spark power, 
but for eight dice of lethal electricity damage (difficulty 
8 to soak). 
The current created with this power is not strong 
enough to force its way through less-than-ideal 
conductors, and thus simply inflicts electrical damage 
raw metals, woods, or other matter in the form of a burn 
and discoloration. The thaumaturge can alternately allow 
the electricity to spark around her hand, eyes, or head; 
this creates illumination about equal to a dim light bulb,
and lowers the difficulty of any Intimidation rolls by 2.",Rites of the Blood,141-142
Thaumaturgy,Path of Levinbolt,4,Thor's Fury,"The thaumaturge may strike her enemies from afar as 
though she were a god. She may direct an arc of lightning 
from her body to nearby targets.","The thaumaturge focuses her concentration 
upon her target and then directs hurled bolts via a 
Perception + Science roll (difficulty 6 plus the range 
in yard/meters, maximum 4 yards/meters). Each success 
inflicts a level of lethal damage (difficulty 8 to soak). The 
source of this power is immediately known.",Rites of the Blood,142
Thaumaturgy,Path of Levinbolt,5,Eye of the Storm,"The thaumaturge becomes a shifting, sparkling pillar of 
electrical power. The energy channeled in the Eye of the 
Storm shields her body from virtually any direct harm.","When a thaumaturge spends a Willpower point 
to invoke this power, she solidifies the stored electricity 
inside of her into a mystical barrier that completely 
sorrounds her. The caster becomes immune to any ranged 
attacks. Metal weapons such as swords inflict injury as 
normal for the first sttrike, but are then melted from 
contact with the barrier, and the wielder takes a level 
of lethal damage. Enemies that dare to touch the caster 
suffer two points of aggravated damage (difficulty 8 to 
soak.) Non-mettal weapons, such as wooden stakes, are not 
affected by Eye of the Storm. This power lasts for a single 
turn, with each additional success on the activattion roll 
extending tthis duration by one turn. Mental and social 
attacks may pass through this barrier.",Rites of the Blood,142
Thaumaturgy,Path of Spirit Manipulation,1,Hermetic Sightt,"The vampire can percieve the spirit world, either by 
gazing deeply into it or by seeing the presence of nearby 
spirits as a hazy overlay on the material world.","Hermetic Sight allows the thaumaturge to 
percieve the spirit realm interlaid over the material 
world for one hour. Each additional level of success on 
the activation roll increases the duration of this power 
by an additional thirty minutes.",Rites of the Blood,142-143
Thaumaturgy,Path of Spirit Manipulation,2,Astral Cant,"The languages of the spirit world are infinitely 
varied and mainly incomprehensible to mortal (and 
immortal) minds. Astral Cant does not teach the 
thaumaturge the tongues of the spirits, but it does 
allow him to understand them as they speak to him 
and to reply in their own languages. The use of this 
power is not always necessary; many spirits speak 
human tongues, but choose to feign ignorance when 
dealing with vampires. Spirits are not affected by 
Dominate, buttt may be manipulated by Presence. Some 
thaumaturges theorize that this is because spirits are 
not actually sentient as a vampire would understand 
the concept, but are manifestations based on the 
perception of those that are self-aware.","Astral Cant allows the thaumaturge to speak to 
any spirit visible via Hermetic Sight for fifteen minutes. 
Each additional level of success on the activation roll 
increases the duration of this power by an additional 
fifteen minutes to the duration.",Rites of the Blood,143
Thaumaturgy,Path of Spirit Manipulation,3,Voice of Command,"This is perhaps the most dangerous power in the 
Spirit Manipulation arsenal, for the consequences 
of failure can be particularly unpleasant. Voice of 
Command allows the thaumaturge to issue orders to 
a spirit, compelling it to heed her bidding whether or 
not it desires to do so. 
Spirits compelled by this power are fully aware that 
they are being forced into these actions, and may well 
seek revenge on their erstwhile masters at a later time. 
Thaumaturges who issue commands above and beyond 
what their spirit servants are compelled to perform may 
find themselves ignored or mocked. A trickster spirit 
may agree to a situation to follow orders only to betray 
its master, leaving the thaumaturge in a situation of 
potentially fatal embarressment.","The thaumaturge makes the normal opposed 
Willpower roll against the spirit. The target spirit 
resists with Willpower (difficulty of the thaumaturge's 
Manipulation + Occult). The degree of success the 
thaumaturge attains determines the complexity and 
severity of the command that she can issue.",Rites of the Blood,143
Thaumaturgy,Path of Spirit Manipulation,4,Entrap Ephemera,"This power allows a thaumaturge to bind a spirit into 
a physical object. This can be done to imprison the 
target, but is more often performed to create a fettish - an 
artifact that grants mystical benefits powered by the spirit. 
Fetishes created by this power are often unreliable and 
understandably displeased with their situation and will 
take any opportunity to escape or thwartt their captors. 
Lupines find it offensive f or vampires to possess a fetish, 
and often will frenzy simply at the sight of a vampire 
wielding one.","The thaumaturge must first locate a vessel 
symbolically aligned with the targeted spirit that will 
eventually become the fetish. Then she must command 
the targeted spirit to enter the vessel via an opposed 
Willpower roll. The target spirit resists with Willpower 
(difficulty equals the thaumaturge's Manipulation + 
Occult).
Should the thaumaturge succeed, she can create a fetish 
of a power level based on the number of successes achieved 
over the spirit, up to a level five fetish. For example, if the 
thaumaturge wins the opposed Willpower roll against the 
spirit by three successes, she creates a level three fetish.

Creating and maintaining a fetish is difficult; because of 
this, the number of fetishes a thaumaturge may creatte is 
limited by her Willpower. If the thaumaturge gives away 
said fetish, it still counts against her total available slots. 
She may only create an additional fetish when one of 
her previous fetishes has been destroyed. 
A fetish grants a number of bonus dice to a specific 
skill comparable to the level of the fetish. For example, 
a healing spirit trapped inside a scalpel would grant 
exttra dice (the level of the fetish) for any Medicine roll. 
The Storyteller always has final authority on what sort 
of fetish can be made. 
A fettish is activatted by rolling the user's Willpower 
(difficulty equals the Fetish's power level + 3). A botch 
on this roll destroys the physical component of the fetish 
and frees the spirit that was trapped within.",Rites of the Blood,143-144
Thaumaturgy,Path of Spirit Manipulation,5,Duality,"The thaumaturge can now fully interact with the spirit 
world - a strange place that only sometimes resembles 
the real world. While using this power, she exists on 
both planes of existence at once. She is able to pick up 
objects in the physical world and place them in the spirit 
world and vice versa. Beings and landscape features in 
both realms are solid to her, and she can engage in any 
manner of interaction. She can even use Thaumaturgy 
and other Disciplines in either world. This is not without 
its dangers. With a single misstep, the vampire can find 
himself trapped in the spirit realm with no way to return 
home. Several incautious thaumaturges have starved into 
torpor while trapped on the other side of the barrier that 
seperates the physical and spirit realms.","The thaumaturge may interact with the spirit 
world for fifteen minutes. Each additional level of 
success on the activation roll increases the duration of 
this power by an additional fifteen minutes. Duality can 
only be enacted while the character begins the process in 
the physical world. While in this state, the thaumaturge 
becomes susceptible to attacks from both realms and 
suffers a +1 difficulty to all Perception rolls. The 
character is still considered to be in the physical world 
for purposes of basic physics (and common sense).
Spirits who have been previously angered will seek 
physical revenge on unwary thaumaturges using this power. 
A botch on the roll to activate this power tears the 
vampire out of the physical world and traps him in the 
spirit realm. The way back to the physical realm, if there is 
one, is left to the Storyteller's discretion, and may spark 
an entirely new story.",Rites of the Blood,144
Thaumaturgy,Gift of Morpheus,1,Cause Sleep,The vampire is able to make a person within her line of sight sleepy just by concentrating. The person may still be awakened by loud noise or someone trying to rouse them.,"HR For the activation, the vampire uses the target's Willpower + 3 as the difficulty, maximum of 10. Three successes puts the target to sleep, while one or two reduces the victim's Dice Pools by that amount for the next turn.

Thaumaturgy,Gift of Morpheus,3,Enchanted Slumber,"The vampire can cause mortals and even Kindred to fall into an enchanted slumber from which they cannot awaken until a certain task has been performed (such as a kiss from Prince Charming). The vampire must decide what special condition must be met for the victim to awaken. While the condition does not have to be easy, it should not be impossible.","HR The vampire must roll to determine how long the person can be kept under the enchantment before it wears off on its own. The number of successes on the activation, difficulty equal to the target's current Willpower, determines the maximum duration the victim sleeps should the task to break the enchantment remain unfulfilled. Victims do not recover Willpower as they slumber, their mind and perception are imprisoned in dreams. The user must also spend a Willpower point to affect vampires.

- 6 Successes: Three Years
- 7 Successes: One Decade
- 8 Successes: One Century
- 9 Successes: One Millenium
- 10 Successes: Permanently until the task is fulfilled. No attempts to escape other than the condition assigned at activation.

Vampire victims enchanted this way can spend a point of Willpower to attempt to escape from their slumber once at the frequency based on the successes minus one. This attempt is immediate at the start of the slumber. The victim rolls their current Willpower, difficulty equal to the number of successes rolled by the thaumaturge +5, maximum of 10. A single success is enough to rouse the victim from their sleep; for every difficulty above 10, an extra success is required.

e.g. A victim was enchanted to fall asleep for one turn, they may spend 1 Willpower point to immediately roll to awaken before their turn is forfeited.

e.g. A victim was enchanted to fall asleep for One Week. Each night, they may spend 1 Willpower point to attempt to awaken before the enchantment is over.

e.g. A victim was enchanted to fall asleep for One Year. Every month, they may spend 1 Willpower point to attempt to awaken before the enchantment is over.",Player's Guide to the Sabbat,114

Thaumaturgy,Alchemy,1,Alchemy,"Thaumaturgy has some of its roots in the early
practices of Hermetic alchemy, which concerned itself
with changing the properties of given ideals. Indeed,
much of Thaumaturgy’s codifi ed structure and basic
principles are very similar to those of alchemy.
In the near-millennium that has passed since the
Tremere’s earliest efforts with blood magic, alchemy
has fallen by the wayside, however. Modern technology
makes possible almost anything this path can do and
far more — it is easier and more reliable to mine for
gold, for example, than it is to create it by transmuting
other materials. Still, old habits die hard among vampires,
and the Tremere are no exception. A few elders
still practice this path, and of these, some still teach it
to their childer to illustrate the basic tenets of modern
blood magic.
 The number of successes on the activation
roll determines how radically a thaumaturge may alter a
given compound’s form. He need not use all his successes
— a thaumaturge wishing to effect only a simple change
of form need not turn lead into gold if he accumulates
fi ve successes. The thaumaturge must, however, acquire
at least the minimum number of successes suggested by
the table below to generate the effect he seeks.
Changing one element into another requires familiarity
with both elements. One cannot suddenly decide
he wants to change a balloon’s worth of helium into a
sphere of solid titanium if he has never dealt with either
of those elements before. Simply knowing an atomic
number is not enough to warp the laws of nature so radically.
It is worthwhile to note, however, that Alchemy
makes no distinction between naturally occurring and
man-made elements — it affects Einsteinium as readily
as it affects carbon.
Note also that this path has fallen out of practice
because it is less useful in modern nights than it was
in the past. Transmutations create Hermetic “ideals”
rather than perfect real-world resources which cannot
be broken down into lesser constructs. A hunk of gold
is a hunk of gold — an attempt to cast coins with it will
reduce the hunk to a pile of inert sludge. Before you ask
— yes, this means your Tremere anarch will not be able
to create nuclear bombs by turning the prince’s shoes
into uranium. There’s nothing wrong with converting
lead into gold and selling that hunk of gold to someone
else, however — caveat emptor!
Note: Storytellers are encouraged to apply this
principle to the use of the Path of Conjuring as well.
Characters who try to conjure “antimatter” or create
weapons of mass destruction magically should be subtly
but reasonably discouraged.
Also, use of this path assumes the thaumaturge
works with the elements in a laboratory-style (or at
least controlled) environment. No vampire will be able
to walk down the street and turn the iron in people’s
blood to helium with a simple touch.
A vampire’s knowledge of Alchemy determines how
greatly she may change a given element.
• Simple changes in form — solid to
liquid, liquid to gas, etc.
•• Complex changes to form — liquid to
a specifi c shape of solid, water to separate hydrogen and
oxygen gas clouds, etc.
••• Complicated changes to form — water
to breathable O2 and loose H2, compounds into separate
elements, etc.
•••• Minor shifts in composition, such as
adjusting an element’s atomic number up to fi ve greater
or less than its original designation.
••••• Miraculous shifts in composition, such
as turning lead into gold or nitrogen into radium.",,Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,68-69

In the near-millennium that has passed since the
Tremere’s earliest efforts with blood magic, alchemy
has fallen by the wayside, however. Modern technology
makes possible almost anything this path can do and
far more — it is easier and more reliable to mine for
gold, for example, than it is to create it by transmuting
other materials. Still, old habits die hard among vampires,

Changing one element into another requires familiarity
with both elements. One cannot suddenly decide
he wants to change a balloon’s worth of helium into a
sphere of solid titanium if he has never dealt with either
of those elements before. Simply knowing an atomic

It is worthwhile to note, however, that Alchemy
makes no distinction between naturally occurring and
man-made elements — it affects Einsteinium as readily
as it affects carbon.
Note also that this path has fallen out of practice

in the past. Transmutations create Hermetic “ideals”

is a hunk of gold — an attempt to cast coins with it will
reduce the hunk to a pile of inert sludge. Before you ask

Thaumaturgy,Biothaumaturgy,1,Thaumaturgical Forensics,"The thaumaturge may take a tissue sample from
a living, dead or undead creature and ascertain its
distinguishing characteristics. A wealth of information
may be gleaned from this sample, including
information that “normal” forensics and genetics
would not yield, such as age, generation, clan, etc."," Each success on the activation roll yields
one piece of simple information about the subject,
which may be any living, undead or dead entity (but
not an inanimate object), including plants. This
information is limited to physical characteristics
of the subject — Thaumaturgical Forensics can be
used to determine gender, clan, traces of diablerie
and the like, but it will not reveal if a given subject
killed an individual or where she kept her trove of
personal belongings.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,70
Thaumaturgy,Biothaumaturgy,2,Thuamaturgical Surgery,"The thaumaturge uses his knowledge of magic and
physiology to aid a body in its regenerative capacity.
Even the most grievous wounds may heal more quickly
if aided by this sorcerous art."," Each success on the player’s roll allows the
thaumaturge to “convert” one health level of damage
to a lesser type. Aggravated damage becomes lethal,
lethal damage becomes bashing and bashing damage
becomes easily slept-off fatigue (and vanishes completely).
Note that the actual surgery does not take the
above-mentioned two weeks to fi nish, but recuperation
times account for that period.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,70
Thaumaturgy,Biothaumaturgy,3,Lesser Anumation,"The thaumaturge mystically endows a dead
lifeform with magical energy and imparts to it a rudimentary
set of instructions. The resultant creations
carry out their orders to the letter; biothaumaturges
use this power to populate their havens with deathless
guard dogs and other, quirkier “pets.”"," This power affects plants and simple
animals — nothing more than a single tree or dog
per use. If the effect is successful, the animated
creation may be given a one-sentence command,
which it will fulfill until destroyed. Minor variations
on the subject may even be made — a thorn thicket
could be animated to move slowly toward intruders
to entangle them, or an animate cat could be given
a set of larger, permanently extended claws that do
additional damage. Specifics should be worked out
with the Storyteller.
Creatures animated in this manner have their
original Strength and Stamina Traits, while their
Dexterity drops by one (but never below 1). Social
and Mental Attributes are considered to be at zero.
Each creation has a number of health levels equal
to half of those it had in life (round up).
Creatures animated in this fashion immediately
crumble to dust if stricken by sunlight, and suffer
double damage from fire.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,70
Thaumaturgy,Biothaumaturgy,4,Greater Animation,"At this level, the thaumaturge has refi ned her
knowledge to allow her to animate more complex
creatures. Even human corpses and large animals may
be given the “spark of life” with this power — one
biothaumaturge in Egypt is rumored to have a pair
of animated elephants with which he terrorizes his
enemies."," This power works the same way as Lesser
Animation, but allows the vampire to animate more
complex creatures. Certain lifeforms are probably
beyond the capacity of this power — zombie whales
sound fairly foolish — but the only limit is what the
Storyteller chooses to allow. This power also allows minor
changes to be made to the subjects, or allows major
changes to be made to lesser subjects. For example, an
animate human corpse may wield a bone-hook instead
of a hand, or a rat might be able to fl y with a pair of
leathery gargoyle-wings made from the bones and skin
of birds and infants.
A human animated in this manner retains none
of his original “self.” This power merely animates the
corpse; it does not reunite the spirit with the body.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,70
Thaumaturgy,Biothaumaturgy,5,Cognizant Construction,"The pinnacle of Biothaumaturgy, this power bestows
a dead creature animated through one of the lesser powers
of this path with a semblance of the intelligence it had
in life. Animated animals possess a malicious cunning
while higher lifeforms gain a shrewd ability to reason
deductively rather than satisfy rote commands."," Although this power gives an animation
a base intelligence, the creature nonetheless still serves
the orders it is given by its creator. A creature animated
via Cognizant Creation has Mental Attributes of one
less than it possessed in life (but never below 1). This
won’t be creating any undead geniuses, but the story
effect is that it creates an animated monster capable of
reasoning. A Cognizant Construction won’t mindlessly
fi ght to its second death if it sees a better or cleverer way
of routing foes, and it will be capable of other deductive
tasks as well.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,71
Thaumaturgy,The Hearth Path,1,Guest's Herald,"This power, when used on a door or other portal,
creates an audible or visual effect that notifi es the
Tremere that someone has crossed it. In this way, the
vampire knows when someone has entered her haven
and can deal with the interloper as she sees fi t."," This power lasts for 24 hours. The signal
may be anything of the thaumaturge’s choosing — a
particularly noisy creak, a tendency to stay ajar or even
something wholly unconnected, like the rotation of
a decanter in another room. In all cases, the effect is
static — it looks or sounds exactly the same every time
it happens. Any point at which someone other than
the thaumaturge crosses a warded area, the effect takes
place. Whether or not the vampire is present to observe
it is a different matter.
Note that complex chains of events are outside the
purview of this power. The ritual will not trigger an
elaborate Rube Goldberg-style “trap” (though it may set
off the fi rst part of one), nor will it aim and fi re a shotgun
at the door. These are simple, subtle, brief effects.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,72-73
Thaumaturgy,The Hearth Path,2,Master's Order,"In his own haven, the thaumaturge knows where
every last article lies. He knows where he placed an
important book, he knows the drawer that the keys to
his safe occupy, and he knows where his ensorcelled
wooden stake rests. He even knows these things when
he doesn’t.…"," As long as this ritual is successful, for the
duration of the scene, the thaumaturge knows exactly
where any given object has been placed, as long as it is
in his haven. This knowledge applies only to inanimate
objects — he may not locate his childe in this manner.
Also, the object must belong to the Tremere himself; an
assassin’s knife will not be found by this power, nor will
the objects on another’s person. Something the Tremere
has stolen will turn up without diffi culty, however.
This power works only in the Tremere’s haven,
where he has spent at least one day’s rest prior to invoking
the power.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,73
Thaumaturgy,The Hearth Path,3,Rhyme of Discord,"The vampire may create a miasma of confusion
in her haven. This power plays upon intruders’ minds,
causing them to become lost in the vampire’s haven,
to lose their direction and misremember specifi c details
such as objects in rooms and their location."," Characters other than the thaumaturge fi nd
themselves hopelessly lost in her haven, no matter how
small it is. Additionally, they are unable to remember
any but the smallest details regarding the place once
inside. Even if an intruder attempts to follow or chase
the Kindred through the haven, she will lose track of
direction, make wrong turns, etc. This effect lasts for
one full 24-hour period, but the confused memories an
intruder takes with her last until she visits the haven
when it is not under this protective ensorcellment.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,73
Thaumaturgy,The Hearth Path,4,Temportal,"As master of her haven, a vampire may briefl y reshape
it so that doorways lead to rooms other than those
to which they are connected. For example, the door to
the bedroom may suddenly open into the study, while
the deepest catacomb of a Transylvanian dungeon might
lead to a tower elsewhere in the castle. Thaumaturges
fi nd this useful both as a convenience — how better to
retrieve a book from the basement when one is on the
third fl oor? — and as an escape route."," This power works until sunrise. At the
thaumaturge’s whim, he may walk through any doorway
in his haven and be immediately transported to any
room of his choice that is also in his haven. Anyone
who follows him through the door will fi nd themselves
in the room the doorway naturally connects to.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,73
Thaumaturgy,The Hearth Path,5,The Cauldron's Rede,"This power bestows a primitive awareness upon the
magus’ haven. While her haven is under this sending,
the thaumaturge may ask any of the items in her haven
about specifi c events taking place therein. A bedroom
mirror may whisper of guests conspiring in the foyer, a
divan may disclose bedchamber indiscretions, and the
lowliest kitchen rug may reveal high treachery taking
place in a salon. Anything occurring within the haven
(or within eyeshot of the outside, as the windows can
“see” as well) can be relayed to an inquisitive magus by
the common items inside."," This power lasts until the sunrise after the
vampire invokes it. The vampire must verbally ask questions
of her haven’s accouterments, should she desire
information from them. Only in case of extreme danger,
such as a pending attack or a haven set ablaze will the
voices of the haven call out to the Kindred.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,73-
Thaumaturgy,Oneiromancy,1,Portents,"From the ephemeral fragments of his own dreams,
the magus may attempt a personal reading of the near
future. While asleep, the oneiromancer draws upon
the dream imagery fl ittering in the unconscious. Upon
waking from the divination, the Cainite may scrutinize
the meaning of the visions. Although these visions of
the present and future are invariably hazy, they often
provide important glimpses into signifi cant events."," This power of Oneiromancy must be used
immediately after awakening and takes the thaumaturge
10 minutes to read the signs. With a successful activation
roll, the Storyteller relates disjoined dream images
allegorically (or sometimes literally) concerning one
forthcoming personal event to the oneiromancer. This
event is completely up to the Storyteller’s discretion,
and multiple uses of Portents may well result in the
same vision occurring over and over again. The Portent
should always be fragmented and cryptic, although the
more successes scored on this activation roll, the more
information the Storyteller should relay to the player.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,75
Thaumaturgy,Oneiromancy,2,Foresee,"Foresee lets the Warlock look into the mind of a
sleeping individual, interpreting her dreams as clues
to future events involving that individual. Used by
thaumaturges in soothsaying, oneiromancers sometimes
gain the trust of people while gleaming unconscious
secrets from the targets."," This power behaves similar to Portents, but
the imagery comes from the dreams of the target and the
divination concerns an event for that person. The subject
must be within the presence of the oneiromancer and
asleep for Foresee to work, though Psychic Projection
also works if the thaumaturge is not physically present.
Additionally, if a Kindred is the subject of this power,
the thaumaturge must spend a Willpower point to successfully
see and understand the prognostication.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,75
Thaumaturgy,Oneiromancy,3,Dreamspeak,"The oneiromancer can now send messages to others
in dream form. Although these messages appear while
the target is asleep, the subject remembers them clearly
after waking. Since these messages are dreams, those
unfamiliar with this power may discount them as such.
More nefarious uses have included sending nightmares
and threats to a victim."," Dreamspeak sends a static dream message,
determined at the time of sending, to anyone the
oneiromancer has previously met. If the subject is not
asleep at the time this power is used, the Dreamspeak
has no effect. While using this power, magi drop into a
trance as with the other divinations of Oneiromancy.
One turn’s worth of dreams can be sent per success of
the activation roll — this won’t allow the thaumaturge
to haunt her victim for a full night, but it will allow her
to leave messages, impart warnings, etc.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,75
Thaumaturgy,Oneiromancy,4,Augury,"Refi ning the power of somnolent divination, the
oneiromancer is able to seek answers to questions and
problems. While specifi c information can be sought
by the oneiromancer, the dream images providing that
knowledge have the same disjoined and confusing quality.
Augury is helpful in seeking answers to problems,
possibly providing the required breakthrough with a
dilemma.
Since fortune-telling and prophesy is convoluting
and bewildering, Augury may not provide any answer
that is useful to the thaumaturge, and has been known
to be completely misleading, as is often the case with
dream-symbols. Let the diviner beware."," Where broken and unguided imagery is the
hallmark of Portents, Augury provides more direction
and continuity. The augury comes to the Warlock in
the same dreamlike imageries but the events are better
understood. Thaumaturges who achieve this level of
skill in the Path of Oneiromancy often have little use
for lesser powers.
Note that the subject must have the knowledge the
thaumaturge seeks, or the power is useless. The Storyteller
has the fi nal say on whether an Augury provides
any benefi cial information, and should not provide any
revelations that will ruin a chronicle or plot.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,75-76
Thaumaturgy,Oneiromancy,5,Reveal the Heart's Dreams,"This power of divination works on a much more
immediate means, the thaumaturge gaining an immediate
insight into the dreams and desires of a person
just by observing them directly. The innermost desire
of the target becomes instantly apparent to the magus.
With this information, a magus is able to approach a
person with offers that are next to impossible to deny.
It is hard to say no to the thing that you desire most.
According to legend, even the hero-king Gilgamesh
left his people in his desire for immortality.
This revelation of the soul occasionally reveals
even more information about the target — that of his
greatest of fears. It is this aspect of revelation that some
say is the power the Followers of Set use to destroy the
souls and virtue of their victims."," This power requires the expenditure of a
point of Willpower (two, in the case of Kindred subjects)
in addition to the normal blood point to activate and
the subject must be within sight of the thaumaturge.
If any successes are scored on the activation roll, the
innermost desire of the target is reveled to the oneiromancer.
Additionally, if more successes are gained on
the activation roll than the subject has Willpower, the
oneiromancer gains an even deeper understanding of
the target’s soul and learns the victim’s innermost fear.
The subject’s reaction to being confronted with this
information is up to the Storyteller (or the player), but
remember that it is their ultimate driving passion.
When confronted with her inner horror, the subject
may be completely paralyzed with fear, or she may frenzy
in the tradition of Rötschreck. Again, the exact results
are up to the Storyteller, but they should be consistent
with confronting one’s worst fears.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,76
Thaumaturgy,Path of the Blood's Curse,1,Ravages of the Beast,"From the moment a Kindred is Embraced, he suffers
the rage and instincts of a primal Beast; it is the fi rst
bane to accompany the Change. If provoked, the Beast
Within sends a vampire into a mindless, berserk frenzy.
Some Kindred struggle to keep their Beasts in check,
while others enjoy riding the waves of this violent rage.
A thaumaturge invoking this power coaxes the Beast to
surface within his target, unleashing a rampant killer."," The subject of this power must make a
frenzy roll (Self-Control, diffi culty 7), as per page 228
of Vampire: The Masquerade. If the victim cannot
resist the Beast, he immediately enters a frenzy the
Storyteller deems appropriate to the situation, whether
rage, Rötschreck, hunger, etc. A thaumaturge may affect
any target within her line of sight.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,76
Thaumaturgy,Path of the Blood's Curse,2,Weight of the Sun,"A concomitant curse of the Embrace is an inability
to remain awake during the daytime. Forced to maintain
a surreptitious existence at night, a Kindred loses the
opportunity to ever again see the sun. As that fi ery-white
globe rises in the east, Kindred feel its pressing weight
as it drives them down into slumber. This power allows
a thaumaturge to invoke the same type of lethargy that
the sun imposes during the long hours of the day."," This power lasts for one scene per success
on the thaumaturge’s Willpower roll. Suffering the same
penalty as if awake during the daytime, a Kindred reduces
his maximum dice pool to equal his humanity (or
Path of Enlightenment). Characters who have achieved
Golconda are immune to this power.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,76
Thaumaturgy,Path of the Blood's Curse,3,Abated Tooth,"All vampires require blood to survive; they depend
on mortal vessels for sustenance and the Kiss to maintain
their unlives. When Kindred do feed, they usually
extend their fangs, to more easily pierce their victim’s
fl esh. By invoking this power, a thaumaturge mystically
dulls a subject’s fangs, robbing him of the ability to use
them effectively. His fangs become so severely blunted
that it becomes nearly impossible to effectively pierce
fl esh, causing affected Kindred to search for alternate
methods of feeding."," Each success the thaumaturge scores dulls
the fangs of his subject for a night. Victims may make
a Stamina (plus Fortitude, if any) roll (diffi culty 8) to
subtract successes from the thaumaturge. While affected
by this power, a Kindred may not use the Bite close
combat maneuver, and her Kiss ceases to cause ecstasy,
instead becoming a “normal” bite.
Storytellers may decide to throw as many obstacles
as deemed necessary at the victim in this sticky situation.
The police do not look kindly on psychopaths
who bite others in the middle of the Rack, and anyone
who feeds carelessly is almost sure to arouse the ire of
Kindred interested in maintaining the Masquerade.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,77
Thaumaturgy,Path of the Blood's Curse,4,Treacherous Bonds,"One of the most potent properties of Kindred vitae
is the ability to create a blood bond. A regnant offering
his blood to a victim on three separate nights fl oods a
thrall with a powerful attraction and devotion to him.
Under a blood bond, the thrall becomes a most loyal
and subservient tool of the regnant and will do anything
to appease him.
Traditionally when the connection of a bond becomes
unstable or weak, emotions of hate may cloud
the mind of the thrall, though it may possibly span
lifetimes before these feelings become evident. The thaumaturge
invoking this power incites an instantaneous,
hate-induced emotional state within a regnant’s thrall;
where once there was love, now only loathing drives his
emotions. This power creates a backlash in the target’s
blood, temporarily twisting any bonds he is under, from
the newest to ones built over years’ time."," The vampire must touch his intended
subject for this power to take effect. For the duration
of one night per success a thaumaturge scores on his
Willpower roll, and depending on whether the magus
chooses to affect a regnant or his thrall, a blood bond
becomes corrupt and unstable. Should a thaumaturge
direct this power at a thrall, only the thrall’s bond
is corrupt, consumed by hate for as many nights as
successes. However, if the thaumaturge chooses to
invoke this power in a regnant, one of the regnant’s
thralls is affected per success. Should a regnant also
be in thrall to someone else while under this effect,
she too will feel only malignity for her regnant.
This power is mistrusted widely by vampires of
Clan Tremere, and had the Ventrue and Lasombra any
real knowledge of it, they would likely balk at it, too
(when they weren’t inflicting it upon their enemies).
More than one regent has levied extreme censure on
vampires learning this power, and an apocryphal story
tells of a European prince putting a Tremere to Final
Death after learning that he had used this power to
turn her ghouls against her.
For example: Clifton Andrews wants to settle a score
with Josephine the Seamstress of Flesh, a Tzimisce, by
reversing the blood bonds of those in her thrall. Clifton’s
player spends a blood point and rolls against a difficulty
of 7 (as this is a Level Four power). He gains three successes
on the roll, and Clifton warps the blood bond in
all five of Josephine’s childer. For the next three nights,
three of Josephine’s blood bound thralls will not only
loathe Josephine but may plot to harm their “tyrannical”
mistress. Clifton’s revenge is sweeter still, as for the span
of these three nights Josephine is racked by fiery hatred for
her own sire, who had blood bound her decades before.
Clifton knows how treacherous the Seamstress of Flesh
is, and rejoices in the knowledge that there is a chance
his enemy will suffer a slow Final Death at the hands of
her sire.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,77-78
Thaumaturgy,Path of the Blood's Curse,5,The Withering of Ages,"This devastating power warps the blood within
vampires, temporarily suspending the properties
sustaining their immortality. A thaumaturge making
physical contact with a victim may strip her of her
agelessness and render her briefl y decrepit. Within
moments, the body of the target will reveal the truth
of her true age, shriveling and shrinking to refl ect
the weight of her years. Additionally, the fangs of the
victim become elongated, and other facial features
accentuate his vampiric nature. Ancient vampires
become crippled, as their bodies become their own
worst enemies."," After the thaumaturge makes physical
contact with her victim, the player engages in
a contested Willpower roll (diffi culty 8). Should he
accumulate more successes than his target, the victim
begins to grow physically older until he fully resembles
his true age.
A character will lose one Physical Attribute point
per 10 years of age he physically gains, to a minimum of
0. Vampires who sink to scores of 0 in Physical Traits
are so enfeebled that they must have help moving,
feeding, etc. and can barely be heard or understood.
This effect lasts for one night, after which time the
victim rapidly sheds his physical years and is restored
to the full potency of his vampiric blood. The affected
Kindred can also restore himself by spending fi ve blood
points and one Willpower point, though this blood
must be spent on the same turn he becomes affl icted.
Once the duration of this power has expired, the victim
will appear as youthful or as old as he was the night of
his Embrace.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,78
Thaumaturgy,Path of Curses,1,Stigma,"The most basic of curses, the victim is stricken with
an invisible stigma that manifests only in the eyes of
those around them. Few can describe its actual form.
People shy away from interacting with the marked
victim, and will have a hard time taking him seriously.
Social interaction becomes diffi cult, and frustration
quickly follows for the accursed."," The stigma lasts until the next sunset,
during which time the victim is doomed to frustration
when performing any Social actions. All of the victim’s
Manipulation, Charisma and Appearance rolls are at
+1 diffi culty (maximum 10) during this curse. Unlike
the Ritual Devil’s Touch, this power also works on
Kindred.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,79
Thaumaturgy,Path of Curses,2,Malady,"The thaumaturge causes the victim to suffer intense
illness and discomfort, not unlike the plagues and pestilences
of history. During the Dark Ages, this power was
used to strike down rivals and force them into subservience
to the thaumaturge. Cainites likewise feel the pain
and suffering from the sickness instilled by this curse.
For elder Kindred, this is one of the worst curses — to
be stricken down with illness as if a common mortal."," If this power is successfully invoked, the
accursed suffers the effects of severe illness for a number
of nights equal to the thaumaturge’s Willpower.
This intensity of this sickness equals the successes the
thaumaturge scores on the activation roll. Each success
reduces the victim’s Strength, Dexterity and Stamina
dice pools by one (with a maximum reduction of three
dice). The affl icted character may also attempt to see
if she breaks the curse nightly — as soon as she succeeds
in resisting, the malady will not affl ict her unless
invoked again.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,79
Thaumaturgy,Path of Curses,3,Pariah,"This curse touches upon one of the most feared
elements of society, that of becoming an outcast. This
power goes beyond cursing the victim with simple social
ostracism — while under the effects of Pariah, the
accursed appears to be the most hated of enemies to
everyone they encounter. This alteration of perception
is only in body and form, the victim still acts and speaks
as normal. But then again, few are willing to listen to
the ranting and ravings of a despised foe."," This nasty curse sustains its baneful effects
upon the subject for a period of one night per success.
Similar to the power Mask of a Thousand Faces, this
power infl uences the perceptions of those around the
accursed, leading observers to believe that the subject
is a dire rival. This will not necessarily result in attack
— indeed, in most cases, it shouldn’t — but will cause
antagonism in whatever way is most appropriate to
the onlooker. Most people will just leave the vampire’s
presence with a look of disdain, but some may snub
her, insult her or even throw the fi rst punch. Unlike
the Obfuscate power, Auspex cannot see through this
involuntary disguise for the duration.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,79-80
Thaumaturgy,Path of Curses,4,Corrupt Body,"This powerful curse is invoked by the thaumaturge,
who approaches the victim and denounces his physical
form. Over the course of seconds, the victim’s body
distorts and perverts into a parody of itself. During this
transformation, the victim suffers extreme pain that
wracks his body. This defi lement leaves behind a victim
scarred both physically and mentally. Recently, Camarilla
princes have had this power used upon violators of
the Traditions to enforce their will; a graceful Kindred
dancer reduced to an uncoordinated oaf is not likely to
forget his mistakes."," During the three turns that the physical
change occurs, the target suffers a three-dice penalty
to dice pools. For the duration of the Corrupt Body,
the accursed suffers a one-die penalty to all dice pools,
as if she were wounded. This is cumulative with other
wounds.
The thaumaturge chooses Strength, Dexterity,
Stamina or Appearance to warp. This drops the appropriate
Attribute to 1 for the duration. The Storyteller
should add any additional effects to aid in how nasty
this power is. Only one Corrupt Body can affect a victim
at any one time. The number of successes determines
the duration of Corrupt Body, as follows:
One success One night
Two successes One week
Three successes One month
Four successes One season
Five successes One year
For example: Elizabeth, a Toreador known for her
acrobatic prowess, is the subject of a Corrupt Body curse
cast by Danica, a regent of Clan Tremere. Danica curses
Elizabeth with the loss of her grace and Dexterity. Spending
a blood point and rolling her Willpower activation, Danica’s
player gains three successes. Elizabeth’s player tries to resist
with Willpower and scores only one success. This yields two
successes, which means that the curse will last one week,
during which Elizabeth has a Dexterity score of 1. The Storyteller
also determines that she suffers from a severe limp
during this time and cannot dance. Needless to say, Elizabeth
is less than happy with this turn of events, and suspects the
strange incantations and gestures made by Danica.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,80
Thaumaturgy,Path of Curses,5,Fall From Grace,"The magus is now able to curse his victim with
supreme ineptitude, causing a loss in confi dence and
failings in any and all tasks. Striking a combination of
mystical dread and self-loathing in the victim, failure
becomes almost a certainty. Fate and circumstance
now conspire to prevent prosperity. Victims of this
power often retire from the normal activities of their
lives as nothing goes right; relationships fall apart, jobs
crumble around them, and accidents seem to become
commonplace."," The victim can contest the effects of
this power with a Willpower roll against a diffi culty
of 8. So severe is this curse that if the victim botches
this Willpower roll, the effects of this power may
become permanent.
While under this curse, the victim cannot automatically
succeed in even the most trivial of tasks. All actions
have one automatic botch die that must be overcome to
accomplish anything (treat this as a phantom die that
came up as a “1”). Additionally, even when the victim
successfully performs an action, it will be mediocre at
best. At most, any action can have a maximum of two
successes; drop additional successes beyond two, including
any from expenditure of Willpower.
Unless the subject botches the contested Willpower
roll, the number of successes determines the duration
of this penultimate failure, as follows:
One success One night
Two successes One week
Three successes One month
Four successes One season
Five successes One year",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,80
Thaumaturgy,Path of Transmutation,1,Fortify the Solid Form,"By fortifying a solid object, a magus increases the
strength and integrity of an item. A thaumaturge mystically
transmutes a feather to become a crude blunt object,
pencils become makeshift stakes, and a car becomes as
tough as a tank."," This power increases the offensive and
defensive capabilities of an object. For each success the
player scores, an object will absorb one health level of
damage. Similarly, a thaumaturge wielding the same
object offensively will infl ict one extra die of damage per
two successes the player scores on the activation roll. In
either case, an object may absorb or infl ict a maximum
of fi ve health levels or dice of damage, respectively. The
effects of fortifying an object last for one scene, and must
either be offensive or defensive — the Platonic ideal of
attack is not the same as for defense.
Note: This power cannot be used to increase the
structure of a living creature. However, a thaumaturge
may use Fortify the Solid Form in conjunction with the
Level Two power Crystallize the Liquid Form to make
a very solid piece of ice, molten metal, etc.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,81
Thaumaturgy,Path of Transmutation,2,Crystallize the Liquid Form,"Tremere designed this power to prevent other
Kindred from taking vitae. This can also be used to
solidify water and molten metal. Liquids within living
bodies may not be altered, though blood exiting
the body may be solidifi ed. Kindred may not consume
solidifi ed blood."," For every success the player scores on the
Willpower roll, the vampire may transform one blood point
(or about two pints of a liquid) into solid form for a scene.
This substance will not change in temperature; solidifi ed
molten steel still burns and melts other material. The liquid
must be within the thaumaturge’s line of sight.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,81
Thaumaturgy,Path of Transmutation,3,Liquefy the Solif Form,"A thaumaturge may “melt” solid objects and leave them
in a liquidlike state. By employing this power, attackers could
fi nd their weapons in small pools at their feet. Stakes rot away
at a rapid pace, and blades corrode into soft, nondescript
puddles. Some wily thaumaturges might even transmute
bullets before they impact an intended target."," The thaumaturge may transform an object
within his line of sight. When the object reforms from
a liquid, it will likely assume a deformed state and be
rendered useless. A transformed object remains in a
liquid state for one scene, after which it resumes its
original shape (which many thaumaturges claim is a
recent improvement over an older, more dated version of
this power). The size of the object that may be changed
depends upon the success of the player’s roll.
One success A lighter
Two successes A telephone
Three successes A computer
Four successes An automobile
Five successes A railroad car
As much as many Tremere would like it, Liquefy
the Solid Form may not be used on living (or
unliving) beings.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,81
Thaumaturgy,Path of Transmutation,4,Gaol,"When a Warlock invokes this power, he solidifi es
the air into an opaque, indestructible object. A crude
shimmering prism forms around a victim’s body, encasing
him within unbreakable material. Doorways become
impenetrable boundaries as the air between a doorjamb
condenses to a resilient barrier."," A Warlock may solidify the air within 50
yards of his person. One success on a Willpower roll
solidifi es an amount of air equivalent to a brick where
fi ve successes will form a solid block of air that can
encompass a telephone booth. Once the air condenses,
it becomes completely indestructible; this effect lasts
for one scene. Victims trapped within the solid air will
not be able to break through this barrier (not even with
Potence), though mortals will not suffocate.
The oxygen within the block is breathable, though
liquidlike. These victims will experience an uncomfortable
sensation in their lungs from the alien dependency
on the oxygenated fl uid, and they may reject it altogether.
When the effect of Gaol expires, the barrier around the
subject dissipates into its original gaseous state. The
oxygen within the target’s lungs, however, will remain
a fl uid and, though breathable, must be purged from the
body — coughed out — before it can transmute back
into a gas. Subjects suffer one level of bashing damage
from this overexertion.
For example: Clifton Andrews notices Rebecca, a ghoul
spy, attempting to sneak into his haven. His player gains
fi ve successes, solidifying enough air to completely capture
Rebecca inside an indestructible block. Immediately after,
Rebecca panics as she breathes the liquidlike oxygen within
the solid block of air. She gulps in mouthfuls of the fl uid while
her body adjusts to the foreign method of breathing, causing
her to retch until she accepts the oxygen. After the solid block
dissipates, Rebecca drops to the ground and throws up all the
liquid she took in while trapped, suffering a level of bashing
damage from the amount of retching she must do before the
liquid purges from her lungs.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,81
Thaumaturgy,Path of Transmutation,5,Ghost Wall,"After attaining this level of mastery, a thaumaturge
fi nds herself no longer hindered by common barriers
such as walls and rock formations. With but a thought,
solid objects shift to a vaporous state and may be traversed
with little diffi culty. The Warlock passes beyond
walls, as they are insubstantial and will not obstruct his
movement. Targets fall through a gaseous fl oor, and
vaporous parachutes are useless in slowing the travel
speed of a skydiver."," A thaumaturge may make vaporous any
nonliving body within his line of sight. For every success
he scores on his Willpower roll, a larger amount
of material transmutes in this manner. It takes a single
success to transmute a laptop computer into vapor, while
it takes fi ve successes to transmute a city bus. A transmuted
object loses its shape and becomes transparent.
This effect lasts for one scene, after which the object
in question reforms as if nothing had ever happened.
Needless to say, this is an outrageous breach of the
Masquerade if any inappropriate eyes observe it.
Should a victim occupy the same space as the
object after this power expires, he suffers a number
of unsoakable health levels of aggravated damage the
Storyteller determines appropriate to the circumstance.
For example, a rock reforming within a body might
infl ict a single level of damage, where a person trapped
within a tree trunk should suffer at least fi ve levels of
damage. Objects that reform partially within another
object will remain this way until physically removed,
or invoked to be vaporous again.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,82
Thaumaturgy,The Vine of Dionysus,1,Methyskein,"By making physical contact with a subject, the
thyrsus causes him to act as if he were drunk. While intoxicated,
the subject falls into a slight euphoric episode,
including slurred speech and clouded judgement."," A victim suffers a one-die penalty to all
Dexterity and Intelligence dice pools for one scene per
success the thaumaturge scores. However, a victim may
make a Stamina roll (diffi culty 6) to subtract successes
scored by the Warlock. Failure on the part of the thyrsus
will not alert her victim to this attempt at intoxication,
though a slight “buzz” may momentarily cause a target
to become disoriented.
Note: A mortal, if affected with Methyskein for
three consecutive nights, lose the ability to willingly
resist this euphoria. Only with the expenditure of a Willpower
point can he initiate a Stamina roll (diffi culty 6).
Kindred react differently should they be exposed to this
infl uence for an equal amount of time. For every three
consecutive nights of intoxication under Methyskein, a
Kindred’s diffi culty to resist on a Stamina roll (diffi culty
6) raises by one, to a maximum of 9.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,82
Thaumaturgy,The Vine of Dionysus,2,Omophagy,"According to myth, Dionysus had the ability to
incite animal urges within anyone he pleased. The
thyrsus invoking Omophagy creates a ravenous hunger
in a target, overwhelming all sense of reason and reality.
To the victim, the only thing that matters is devouring
raw fl esh and hot blood, and he is not choosy about his
potential targets."," Once the thaumaturge makes eye contact
with a subject, and successfully invokes this power, a
target gains the derangement Gluttony (page 162 in
the Guide to the Sabbat). Whenever consuming food,
the subject will gorge himself until physically unable
to eat more. Kindred affected by Omophagy not only
drain a vessel completely of blood, but may also attempt
to devour the victim’s body. Vampires will also frenzy
when confronted with the sight, smell or taste of blood
when hungry (blood pool of three or less). This effect
lasts for the remainder of the night. A victim may resist
this effect by spending a point of Willpower to ignore
Omophagy for a scene. Note that this power does not
impart vampires with the ability to digest food — any
fl esh or food they eat will be immediately vomited forth
unless other circumstances prevail.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,82
Thaumaturgy,The Vine of Dionysus,3,Hamartia,"Far less subtle than Methyskein, Hamartia grants
the thyrsus the power to cause an extremely danger
ous euphoric episode within a target, to the point of
delirium, perversity and possibly torpid stupor. Cultists
of Dionysus claim to gain superhuman vigor while in a
similar state of intoxication on oinos."," For each success on the activation roll,
a subject remains under the effects of Hamartia for
a scene. Victims affected lower all dice pools by two,
though they gain two dice to Strength-related pools.
Targets can resist this effect by scoring more successes
on a Stamina roll (diffi culty 7). The Storyteller should
decide how a character reacts to this type of intoxication,
as a character’s Nature may dictate actions. Some
might stand very still and glassy-eyed, while others
might choose to engage in conjugal relations with the
people around them (gender notwithstanding). This
power lasts for one scene.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,82-83
Thaumaturgy,The Vine of Dionysus,4,Enthousiasmos,"A thyrsus may exude a pheromone into the air all
about her person. Those affected fall into a druglike
stupor as the empathogenic toxin induces visions of
all sorts of ephemeral creatures: fauns chasing nymphs,
angels in fl ight, sprites dancing in the corners of one’s
eyes, and the like. The pheromone induces a happiness
within the affected targets, who are likely to
dance around in glee to fi ctitious music with makebelieve
creatures."," A thaumaturge successfully invoking this
affects any target within a 10-foot radius of herself.
Victims suffer a two-dice penalty to all Dexterity and
Intelligence dice pools for one scene. Furthermore,
victims under the effects of Enthousiasmós are passive,
content to while away their time in the euphoric haze.
Anyone wishing to take any action must spend a point
of Willpower to shrug off its effects for a turn.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,83
Thaumaturgy,The Vine of Dionysus,5,Oinos Aimatos,"Many thaumaturges suspect that this power is not
the original apex of this path, but rather a variation
suited to a Dionysian cult headed by a vampire passing
himself off as an incarnation of the god. When the thyrsus
invokes this power, her blood takes on the properties of
potent oinos. Whether this was intended as a deterrent
to diablerists or to drive feeding ghouls into euphoric
ecstasy is unknown."," For the duration of one scene, anyone drinking
even the tiniest drop of the thyrsus’ blood is affected
as per Enthousiasmós. The thaumaturge’s player need
only spend a point of blood and make a Willpower roll
when the character fi rst invokes this power — thereafter,
anyone who drinks the blood suffers the effects without
any further expenditure on the part of the vampire.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,83
Thaumaturgy,The Faux Path,1,"Hello, Goodbye","The thaumaturge has a basic understanding of the magic of falsity. She may cause any one true
statement she makes to be perceived as a lie for the duration of the evening. At dawn, all Kindred
affected will be able to make their own judgements about the statement. She cannot make lies appear
to be true, however."," With successful invocation, this power causes any listeners who hear the true statement
immediately disbelieve it. This magic does not affect Aura readings, a Bone of Lies or other
Discipline usage of greater power than this Discipline.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,84
Thaumaturgy,The Faux Path,2,Disciplinary Identification,"One of the primary skills of the deceiver is the ability to recognize when she is being deceived.
With suffi cient training, the thaumaturge can identify which Disciplines are being used in front of
her, and, with a suffi cient explanation or by looking at the results (such as a ghoul’s arm affected by
Vicissitude), can even identify Disciplines not directly witnessed."," The thaumaturge can identify the Discipline used in any situation. Only Disciplines may
be identifi ed directly, whereas the powers of other supernatural creatures (but not hedge magic) are
identifi ed only as “powers belonging to something else.” A Storyteller may allow a bonus to Kindred
possessing one or more of the skills of Kindred, Camarilla or Sabbat Lore (where appropriate). A
Kindred cannot concentrate long enough to identify Disciplines used on her while she is engaged
in combat, though she may remember the effects and identify them later. Regardless of specifi cs, at
this level all “thaumaturgical” effects, whether hedge magic, True Faith, Dark Thaumaturgy or even
other uses of the Faux Path register as “Thaumaturgy.”
Note that a character may not identify a Discipline with which she is not at least somewhat
familiar. For example, a character is unlikely to know of the more esoteric Disciplines of certain minor
bloodlines, while Dominate should be fairly obvious. Also, this is not a “catalogue” of Disciplines,
as the information is gained mystically. A Camarilla Kindred may never have seen another Kindred
using Telepathy, but would be able to identify it using this power through familiarity with Auspex.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,84
Thaumaturgy,The Faux Path,3,Thaumaturgical Nomenclature,"Once the chaff has been separated from the wheat, so to speak, identifi cation of the most versatile
Discipline of Thaumaturgy remains. Despite the frustrated thoughts of some young Tremere, no
limit exists to the number of paths a thaumaturge may learn. However, some of the more common
elements of Thaumaturgy can be identifi ed."," A power described as “Thaumaturgy” by Discipline Identifi cation can be further
identifi ed as to the path, power or ritual, or even as true magic, if this is the case. In case of a truly
obtuse, unique or unknown path, a result of “unquantifi ed” is not uncommon. Note that if an effect
is incorrectly assumed to be Thaumaturgy (without using the Level Two power), the results of this
Discipline will be incorrect as well. For example, a Kindred who has caught his hand on fi re and is
using Fortitude to resist the damage may be incorrectly identifi ed as using the Lure of Flames.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,85
Thaumaturgy,The Faux Path,4,Ritual Madness,"By now, many Kindred are aware that most powers and rituals have a limited range. With the
public and private transportation options available to most Kindred, even the dreaded Splinter
Servant holds little terror if the victim can stave off his attacker for a mere minute. A clever thaumaturge
can use this knowledge against her enemies."," Using this power, any thaumaturgical effect a vampire extemporizes can be “modifi ed”
to supply only a physical sensation, but no actual effect. For example, a Warlock may cause Kindred
approaching him to feel “vague discomfort and uneasiness” with no explanation, though a successful
Aura Perception might discover sparkles indicative of any other magical effect. Likewise, a
vampire may “Engage the Vessel of Non-Transference,” which causes another Kindred to feel a cold
shiver if she touches a certain object. The much-vaunted “Ward Versus Fools” causes an individual
to feel as though he is approaching a ward designed against his “creature type,” whether Lupine,
ghoul, mortal, ghost, Kindred. A cagey Kindred can even claim “next time, it’ll be the real thing,”
regardless of his or her true powers. This is an uncommonly versatile path power, but its effects are
always mental (and psychosomatic) in nature.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,85
Thaumaturgy,The Faux Path,5,Sanguinary Affectation,"Once a careful study has been made of various Disciplines, the thaumaturge can then seek to
duplicate the outward effects upon his own self. For example, a Tremere’s hands may seem to grow
claws, he can make other seem to bow to his whim, or his hands may crackle with the lambent
fi res of an unmastered but familiar path. Of course, his nails are merely long and cause no damage
beyond normal, the patsy was going to do what the vampire said anyway, and his hands couldn’t
light a cigarette."," After a successful roll, the player spends a Willpower, and can then successfully duplicate
the outward effect of almost any Discipline, path or ritual of Level Five or below upon his or
her own person, by fulfi lling the normal prerequisites of the Discipline (blood expenditure, Willpower
costs, etc.), for one turn. Note that a Kindred duplicating Celerity, for example, could not actually
move faster than a normal Kindred, but she could perform parlor tricks with Faux Celerity, such as
“snatching the pebble from the hand of the Master” and the like. Of course, to snatch the pebble
from the hand of someone with Celerity may well require her to spend the extra blood, and even
then she would likely have to win a contested roll. But convincing a convocation of other Kindred
that she has this speed might be worth the cost, even though she could never even outrun Kindred
with only one dot in Celerity using this path’s powers.",Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,85
Thaumaturgy,Path of Shadowcrafting,1,Out Light,"The first rule of shade: darkness overcomes all light.
Eventually, every light gutters and fades. A neophyte thaumaturge
can exert this property of darkness, bringing a sordid
mortality to lights nearby. The lights may flicker and dim or
even snuff completely, depending upon their strength and
the thaumaturge’s will."," The thaumaturge can focus darkness upon any
one light source within her range of sight. Only lights up to
the strength of a torch, light bulb or modern neon sign can
be affected, but complete success snuffs a light permanently
(light bulbs and neon signs burn out; candles go out, but
could be re-lit later). Successes scored on the casting roll
determine the strength of the fading.

4 Light source blacks out completely for two turns,

Test. If you win, a small light source that you can see suddenly
goes out. If you tie, it flickers and gutters noticeably for
several seconds. If you lose, there is no effect. You can only
affect a light source that could easily be held in one hand and
that does not put out more light than a good flashlight — a
candle, lantern, flashlight or bulb could be extinguished, but
a camera flash, spotlight or a halogen lamp could not be. If
the light source was a flame and you manage to put it out,
you also douse the flame.",Clanbook: Tremere,53

thaumaturge to take command of a distant shadow. By sympathetically
linking it to his body, the thaumaturge makes
the distant shadow obey his own shadow’s motion. The caster
can jape, threaten or move about and cause the faraway
shadow to behave in similar fashion. If the shadow belongs
to a person, it follows the thaumaturge’s actions. Shadows
of other than anthropomorphic shape contort as best they
can, stretching, elongating and moving in a semblance of
the caster’s motion. A shadow controlled in this fashion
cannot actually do harm, nor does it harm its source, but
it certainly proves unnerving. On at least one occasion, a
Tremere novice managed to humiliate an opponent simply
by making the Kindred’s shadow subtly berate him; when
the aggrieved Kindred brought the matter to the attention
of the harpies, he found himself roundly scathed — “Afraid
of your own shadow now?”"," Successes scored on the Willpower roll for this
effect determine how many turns the caster can control a
distant shadow. Only one shadow at a time may be so influenced.
Shadows animated in this fashion can move and
even pantomime as they follow the thaumaturge’s actions,
but they cannot make sound, nor do they actually break away
from their casting source (so, if the thaumaturge leaves, the
shadow moves as if running in place). The caster must be able
to see the shadow that he wishes to manipulate, and it must
be a natural shadow, not one created with Obtenebration.
MET You need only indicate a distant shadow
and spend the usual time and Blood Trait to invoke this power
of Thaumaturgy. Once you’ve invoked Shadow Taunt, you can
completely control the actions of a shadow that you can see
for so long as you concentrate on it. You should either indicate
its pantomimes to the subject casting it, or inform a Narrator
who can relay the shadow’s unusual actions. If nothing else,
this can serve as an unusual distraction. As above, this power
has no effect upon Obtenebration.",Clanbook: Tremere,53-54
Thaumaturgy,Path of Shadowcrafting,3,Coruscating Shadow,"How would shadow appear if it hovered in the air? a
discoloration? a dimness in the atmosphere? a hole in space?
A commanding Tremere can peel the very shade from surrounding
surfaces and bend it into floating forms that whip
about. These airborne shadows conceal the caster and create
a roiling sphere of confusion. The unnatural display manifests
as an ephemeral globe that encompasses the caster at about
arm’s length, though it contracts and expands rapidly while
the shadows flit about its surface."," Under the effects of Coruscating Shadow, the
Tremere gains partial concealment due to the rapidly strobing
passage of shadowy shapes. The ball of shadows that
surrounds the caster has no physical substance but expands
and contracts, writhes and spins and generally makes matters
difficult for anyone trying to observe the thaumaturge.
Raise the difficulty of actions that affect the caster, including
attacks, by one while this power is in effect. Furthermore,
the heavier prevalence of shadow helps when blending into
darkened areas, giving the player a two-die bonus to Stealth
rolls for the character. The sphere lasts for one turn per success
garnered on the roll.
MET Indicate Coruscating Shadow by crossing
your arms at neck level, palms out with your fingers
spread. Any onlooker can note the plainly unusual sight.
You gain one bonus Trait to resolution in all challenges of
stealth and when defending against any physical attack.
The sphere lasts for one turn for every Trait of permanent
Willpower that you have.",Clanbook: Tremere,54
Thaumaturgy,Path of Shadowcrafting,4,Night's Veil,"Shadows seem to devour the landscape hungrily as night
falls. Where any shadow lies, the power of night remains —
through that sympathetic power the Tremere can invoke the
strength of night in any place. Mortals who have observed
this bizarre power have left the experience “touched,” talking
of shadows impossible in the current light and non-Euclidian
geometries casting horrid shades."," Like other Shadowcrafting powers, the Tremere
must extend existing shadows. Typically, the caster stands
within a shadowed corner and invokes this power. In each
successive turn, the shadow slowly expands to cover greater
ground. Such mystically enhanced shade can even reach out
into sunlit stretches. The shade extends about a yard beyond
its normal distance for each success scored on the roll. For
the rest of the scene, the shade counts as an area under the
province of night: the Tremere can act normally without
hindrance from daytime and avoid the sun’s rays. Should
the caster step outside the shadow (whether accidentally or
purposefully), though, the effect ends immediately — quite
possibly stranding the Tremere, dizzy and disoriented, in
burning sunlight.
MET By casting Night’s Veil, you can cause an
area of shadow to expand beyond what would be its natural
length. The pre-existing shadow is considered to extend an
additional yard in each direction. So long as you remain within
this shadow, the area counts as being under the influence of
night. This lasts for the rest of the scene or an hour.",Clanbook: Tremere,55
Thaumaturgy,Path of Shadowcrafting,5,Abyssal Pact,"Mastery of the Path of Shadowcrafting allows a Tremere
to imbue his shades with some semblance of substance. At this
level of expertise, the path truly takes on some characteristics
of tangible nightmares. While smothered in darkness, the
Tremere lets loose something that seems hungry and malevolent.
Mastery of such shade creations also gives the Tremere
a small chance to counter the Obtenebration Discipline,
though such hope perhaps leads more to overconfidence
than to conquest.
The creator of the Shadowcrafting path, now a chattering
invalid, maintains during brief moments of lucidity
that strange shadow entities wait in every darkened corner.
Certainly the shades conjured by this path give some credence
to such notions, but the Kindred in question asserts that these
beings devour light and feed upon the very essences of those
who would dare truck with them. If these are, perhaps, the
primal fiends that deal with the Lasbombra’s fluid darkness,
then perhaps their secrets are best left hidden — their unnatural
kin were never meant to withstand the light."," To summon the final powers of Shadowcrafting,
both the Tremere and the target must be within the same
patch of darkness — two individuals in a closet, or both out
on the street on a moonless night. The Tremere does not need
to see the individual, but must somehow sense the victim’s
presence, whether by hearing, touch or some other apprehension.
Furthermore, the darkness must be total or near-total;
simple shadows do not suffice. Conjuring the esurient shadow
costs five blood points (total, not in addition to the usual
Thaumaturgy costs).
Once created, the shade-form assaults the victim and
drains vitality. Tangible shadow attacks envelop the victim
in a smothering blanket of darkness that bites like a school
of barracuda. Every two successes scored on the casting roll
cause the victim to lose one health level of lethal damage;
additionally, the victim loses one point of Stamina for the
remainder of the scene, as the hungry shadows suck out the
very essence of living vitality (note that Kindred can use their
blood to restore such losses until the next scene). Subsequent
attacks are cumulative, so it’s possible to wear a victim down
over multiple turns, though that’s certainly expensive and
time-consuming for all but the most proficient thaumaturges.
The abyssal shades conjured with this power can be used
to fight against Obtenebration, but they seem reluctant to
do so. Instead of inflicting damage upon an opponent, the
caster can direct the shadow power so that every two successes
scored by the player removes one success from an Obtenebration
effect. This can negate a power entirely or reduce its
efficacy. Of course, the Lasombra can simply reactivate the
appropriate Obtenebration powers, probably without nearly
as much effort, but the surprise alone can prove invaluable.
Should the thaumaturge botch the casting roll, the
shades still manifest but attack him instead, in addition to
the normal Thaumaturgy botch penalty of one permanent
Willpower point. Roll six dice and apply the results as specified
above for every two successes.
MET When you cast this power, you must specify
whether you wish to conjure shades against an opponent or
counter Obtenebration. If you conjure shades, you make a
Simple Test — on a win, your victim suffers two levels of
lethal damage and the Negative Physical Trait Sickly; on a tie,
the victim suffers one level of lethal damage; on a loss, you
instead take one level of lethal damage. Should you attempt to
counter Obtenebration, you make a Mental Challenge against
the target in question, and if you win the Obtenebration power
fails completely. If you lose, you take a level of lethal damage.
The Obtenebration user gains a free retest to resist the power.
In either case, you must expend a phenomenal five Blood
Traits (total) to invoke the Abyssal Pact.",Clanbook: Tremere,55-56

The affected doorway is imbued with sufficient magical fortification to hold back the ferocious strength of a werewolf or the head of a battering ram.

The ward can be destroyed as usual, but always fades after the time limit expires. A clever Thaumaturgist hides a glyph from sunlight but still makes it useful.
The vampire can establish a telepathic connection with any one of her wards instantly, but never with more than one at a time. She can move about as normal while focusing on a ward, but all difficulties increase by two.

By focusing on the ward, the Cainite can see and hear everything around it. She can also speak through the glyph. The vampire can choose to ""transmit"" another Thaumaturgical power through the glyph, as long as the power's requirements can be met (physical contact with the target of the power is not required, for example).

Setite Sorcery,The Path of Blood Nectar (Sadhana),5,The Path of Blood Nectar (Sadhana),"Amrita is the Nectar of Divinity that grants perfect
bliss and immortality to all who drink it. At the creation
of the world, the gods needed the help of the asuras to
obtain the Amrita. The demon-gods demanded a share of
the nectar, but cunning Vishnu tricked them out of their
portion. Those demons who became incarnate as Kindred
eventually learned to create their own nectar of divinity. All
Kindred can confer a fraction of undead power upon mortals
by feeding them vitae, turning them into ghouls. Through
the Path of Blood Nectar, an undead sadhu can do much
more — turning her blood into a potion that briefl y confers
any one of her powers on a mortal or another vampire.
A few sorcerers of the Banu Haqim clan also know this
path, and fi nd it a useful adjunct to Quietus. Other practitioners
of Dur-An-Ki have not yet learned to produce
Blood Nectar.
 Blood Nectar requires one minute of concentration
per level of the potion created. In this time, the
vampire engages in yogic and vitae-shifting exercises and
meditation. The character’s player needs a single success on
a Willpower roll, at the usual diffi culty for a path power. At
the end of this period, the alchemist opens a vein to release
the blood nectar. Another person must drink the blood nectar
immediately to gain its effects: The nectar loses potency
within one minute of leaving the sorcerer’s body.
Unlike most paths, Blood Nectar costs one blood point
per level to use.
Each dose of Blood Nectar confers one of the sadhu’s
powers upon the imbiber for a single scene. The sorcerer can
confer either Disciplines or Thaumaturgical path powers, but
not the effects of rituals. Of course, a sorcerer cannot impart
a Discipline at a higher level than she herself knows.
Someone who imbibes a Blood Nectar gains that Discipline
or path, up to the level the sorcerer chose to store.
For instance, a level three nectar of Dominate would enable
the imbiber to use the fi rst three powers of that Discipline.
If the imbiber already knows the Discipline to as high or
higher level than the potion carries, the Blood Nectar has no
effect except to grant the person one blood point’s worth of
vitae. Each dose of Blood Nectar counts as one blood point,
no many how much vitae its creation consumed.
A person who drinks Blood Nectar does not gain any
of the sorcerer’s Abilities, so he might not be very good at
using the powers gained. On the other hand, he might possess
more innate talent (represented by a higher Attribute
+ Ability pool) than the sadhu herself.

Setite Sorcery,The Path of Karma (Sadhana),1,Threads of the Past,"The first siddhi of this path is knowledge of the important
events of another person’s past — the events that made her
who she is tonight, and brought her to her present place."," For each success rolled by the player, the
character receives one brief impression of an important
event in the target’s past. As a guideline, the Storyteller
should describe each impression in one short paragraph of
pure description, like a snapshot. The sadhu does not receive
these impressions in any particular order; he can only guess
at their interpretation. If the sadhu uses this power on a
Kindred, however, the list of impressions always includes
the subject’s Embrace as the single most important event in
that person’s existence. The sorcerer also learns the target’s
common name (though not his True Name).",Blood Sacrifice: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,63
Setite Sorcery,The Path of Karma (Sadhana),2,Weave of the Future,"The sadhu can receive brief impressions of potentially
important events within the next year of the subject’s
existence. The events may be good or bad, dangers or opportunities.
A person can try to avoid foreseen dangers, but
this is never reliable. Sometimes the very action taken to
avoid an event causes it to take place.
A sadhu can use this power for his own benefi t, but only
rarely. He cannot learn about events from his own future
until all the events previously foreseen either have taken
place or he has successfully avoided them."," For each success the player rolls, the sadhu sees
one brief scene from the target’s future (or his own). Again,
the Storyteller should describe these in one image, like a
snapshot, with no explanation of context or meaning, though
the character can see if the subject faces obvious danger.",Blood Sacrifice: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,63
Setite Sorcery,The Path of Karma (Sadhana),3,Certain Fate,"At this level, a sadhu can see farther and pick out the
events, people and forces that inexorably shape the person’s
future. The magician gains more detailed knowledge, but
the subject has less chance to change the future: The events
grow from the whole shape of the person’s life and, Hindus
believe, past lives. Once again, these aren’t necessarily bad
things, but the Certain Fate often presents dire but obscure
warnings. A sadhu cannot use this power on herself."," For each success rolled, the character receives
one fact about the subject’s entire future existence; for instance,
an important confl ict he will face, or a person who
will become important to him in some way. As is the way with
prophecies, the sorcerer sees the setup of future situations but
generally not how they turn out. If the sadhu receives three
or more successes, the visions include a scene of the subject’s
most probable death and whether or not a mortal subject is
destined to become a Kindred, wraith or kuei-jin.",Blood Sacrifice: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,63
Setite Sorcery,The Path of Karma (Sadhana),4,Past Lives,"At this level, a sadhu obtains moderately detailed,
capsule biographies of a person’s previous incarnations.
A sorcerer can examine her own past lives, too. In India,
people believe that events in this life reward and punish
their deeds in past lives, so knowing previous incarnations
can help one cope with this life’s trials. The sooner you
expiate your sins, the sooner you can accumulate merit for
a better life in your next incarnation.
On a more practical level, a sadhu can use this power to
temporarily gain Abilities that she knew in her past lives.
She can thus gain virtually any skill she wants."," Each use of this power provides an overview
of one of the subject’s past lives. By itself, this has no immediate,
practical benefi t, but it’s a great way to impress
one’s aptitudes on other people: They instinctively know
that the sadhu tells them the truth.
A sadhu can also use this power to “remember” Abilities
from her own past lives. For each success her player rolls,
the sadhu gains one dot to place in any Ability she wants,
subject only to the limitation that she cannot raise any
Ability above three dots. The Abilities last a single scene.
Note that the Ability comes from a past life, and are thus
limited by the age of the Cainite in question. For example, a
thousand-year-old sadhu would not be able to call upon her
past lives for potential with the Computer Knowledge.",Blood Sacrifice: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,63
Setite Sorcery,The Path of Karma (Sadhana),5,Master of Samsara,"Samsara is the cycle of birth, death and rebirth. A
master of Karma can not only look ahead to see a person’s
next incarnation, he can shape that incarnation to some
degree. Even more amazingly, he has a limited power to
reverse the wheel of samsara and briefl y restore people to a
previous incarnation."," All applications of this power require only a
single success on the player’s roll, but demand that the player
spend one point of permanent Willpower. For this, the sadhu
not only receives a capsule description of the person’s next
life, he can perform one of the following feats:
• Ordain one fact about that person’s future life (nearly
anything, comparable in power to imposing a Dark Fate but
it could just as easily be a good thing).
• Preordain that a person becomes a wraith or Cathayan
vampire upon death… or not.
• Transform a mortal (not a vampire) into whoever or whatever
she was in a previous life for one scene. The target character
retains only a dreamlike awareness of her “current” self. The
subject temporarily becomes a different character. The sadhu can
choose among the incarnations revealed by the Past Lives power,
transform the subject in her immediately previous incarnation,
or leave it all to chance and the Storyteller’s whim.
• Transform a mortal (not a vampire) into whoever or
whatever he will be in his next life; or
• Set the circumstances of his own next incarnation.
An undead sadhu can view and select his own future existence
after his destruction as a vampire, but cannot use any of the
other powers on himself. A sadhu who uses Master of Samsara
often takes a rather casual attitude to the prospect of Final
Death, since the sadhu has already selected a comfortable next
incarnation… possibly including revenge on his enemies.",Blood Sacrifice: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,63-64

function, but it need not come from the wangateur and,
in fact, can come from an enemy (human or Kindred) who

Furthermore, the wangateur can maintain a number of
mixtures up to his Intelligence simultaneously. Thus, he
can provide the mixtures to allies and no longer needs to be
nearby in order to provide the appropriate benefits — he can
simply give the mixture to an ally and send her on her way.",,Rites of the Blood,166
Setite Sorcery,Orisha's Fortune (Wanga),1,Sheltering Hand,"At this level, the wangateur can use orisha’s Favor to
prevent catastrophe. The subject is granted just a bit of extra
fortune; he may still fail, but he fi nds disasters occurring
far less frequently."," The wangateur chooses his subject — either
himself or an ally. The next action attempted by the subject
is less likely to botch; the number of 1’s rolled must exceed
the caster’s successes for a botch to occur. Thus, if the player
rolls 3 successes when invoking Sheltering Hand, his next
roll must come up with at least four 1’s (and no successes)
to be considered a botch. Botches avoided in this fashion
still carry all the results of a normal failure; this power
prevents disaster, but it cannot turn a failure into a success.
It applies only to the next action taken by the subject, or
for the fi rst turn if the action is extended. If the roll to
invoke this power indicates a botch, the subject suffers
the opposite effect; every 1 rolled by the player counts as
an added botch on the subject’s own action.",Blood Sacrifice: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,79
Setite Sorcery,Orisha's Fortune (Wanga),2,Fortune's Blessing,"The wangateur requests the orishas’ aid for herself or an
ally. Luck is with her; tasks become simpler and less likely
to fail and the recipient may even fi nd herself capable of
feats that would normally prove too diffi cult to perform."," The specifi c task — hacking, driving, shooting
or any other mundane action — must be declared when
the power is invoked. For the duration of the scene, the
recipient fi nds the diffi culty of the specifi ed task lowered
by 1 (to a minimum of 4).
Multiple uses of this power are not cumulative, nor can
a poor roll be superceded or replaced by a better one. Any
attempt to use it on someone already under its infl uence
automatically fails.",Blood Sacrifice: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,79
Setite Sorcery,Orisha's Fortune (Wanga),3,Fortune's Curse,"The reverse of Fortune’s Blessing, this power allows
the wangateur to infl ict minor misfortune upon an enemy,
making a single task more diffi cult and likely to fail."," The caster must declare a specifi c sort of action
— brawling, sneaking or the like — when the power is
invoked. The target of the spell fi nds his diffi culty increased
by 1 (maximum 9) when attempting that action; this power
lasts for the scene.
This power is not cumulative, and should be considered
a failure if used on someone already under its infl uence.",Blood Sacrifice: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,79
Setite Sorcery,Orisha's Fortune (Wanga),4,Fortune's Favor,"The wangateur calls upon the spirits to perform some
truly hefty twisting of the laws of probability. Blows that
should land, contests that clearly favor the opposition — all
seem to shift inexplicably in favor of the wangateur."," At the moment of casting, the caster must
choose a specifi c individual against whom this power
operates. Once this power is invoked, the wangateur is
protected by an effect that seems to combine aspects of
the previous two powers. All of the target’s rolls are at +1
diffi culty (maximum 10). All the caster’s rolls are at -1 diffi
culty (minimum 4), but only when in direct opposition
to the target (attack rolls, dodges and contested actions).
Fortune’s Favor lasts for a number of turns equal to the
wangateur’s successes.
The caster cannot use Fortune’s Favor while under
the effects of Fortune’s Blessing, nor can she use it against
anyone already infl uenced by Fortune’s Curse.",Blood Sacrifice: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,79
Setite Sorcery,Orisha's Fortune (Wanga),5,Smiting Hand,"A truly nasty magic, Smiting Hand sets the power of
the orishas directly against a foe, transforming almost any
attempted task into a catastrophic failure."," Every success achieved by the caster becomes
a “phantom botch” that the target must overcome on his
next roll. Thus, if the caster achieves 3 successes, the target’s
next roll is considered to have 3 extra dice that all came
up 1. Furthermore, any failure while under the infl uence
of this power is considered a botch, rather than a mere
failure. For example, if the aforementioned victim rolled
10, 7, 3, 2 and 2, that would normally be a failure — the
phantom 1’s cancel out the 7 and the 10. Because of the
power of Smiting Hand, however, the result is a botch even
though successes were rolled. The Storyteller is encouraged to
have such botches result in truly catastrophic results, even
as compared to “normal” botches; those who threaten the
favored of the orishas deserve whatever happens to them.",Blood Sacrifice: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,79
Setite Sorcery,Voice of the Wild (Wanga),1,Scent of the Beast,"The magician can produce scents and pheromones appropriate
to a particular species of animal. Used in ancient
nights to attract game and ward off predators, it fi nds similar
use tonight among more creative wangateurs."," The caster must have in her possession a sample
(tuft of fur, whisker, tooth, drop of blood, etc.) from the
animal she wishes to smell like. If successful, the Kindred
gives off a scent identical to that of the target animal for the
remainder of the scene. Three successes allow the wangateur
to smell like that animal in a particular emotional state;
she could, for instance, duplicate the scent of a scared cat
or a dog in heat. With fi ve successes, the power is effective
enough to fool an animal ghoul. Five successes will
also permit the caster to fool Lupines, Kindred in animal
form, or Kindred using Auspex, but these received an
opposed Perception + Alertness roll (diffi culty 6). If this
opposed roll is successful, the Lupine or Kindred notices
something subtly off about the caster’s scent, and may well
investigate further.
Any attempt to attract an animal must achieve at
least three successes to inspire the creature to overcome
its instinctive aversion to vampires; fewer successes mean
that the animal will approach to within a few yards, but
no closer. Any attempt to create a scent strong enough to
affect a human or a Kindred not using Auspex (duplicating
the spray of a skunk, for instance) also requires three
successes.",Blood Sacrifice: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,80
Setite Sorcery,Voice of the Wild (Wanga),2,Hide from Hunter's Eyes,"The cities of the 21st century may house vicious guard
dogs rather than hungry lions, but the effect of this power
is much the same as it was in nights past. With this power,
the Kindred causes animals to overlook her completely. This
applies to scent and hearing as well as sight. Although few
animals willingly attack Kindred, this is powerful protection
against those that will. Perhaps more importantly, it
prevents dogs and other guard animals from rousing the
neighbors."," The wangateur must have a body part (fur, hair
or a tooth will suffi ce) from the kind of animal she wishes
to hide from, and a pinch of pepper, drop of perfume or
any other strongly scented material. This must be rubbed
on the sample as the blood is spent. For the remainder of
the scene, animals of the specifi ed variety (dogs being the
most common in modern cities) simply don’t notice the
Kindred’s presence unless she specifi cally does something to
attract attention (touching the animal, making any noise
louder than low conversation or the like).
This power requires fi ve successes to fool Lupines
or Kindred in animal form, but they receive an opposed
Perception + Alertness roll to see through it (diffi culty
6). It functions on animal ghouls regardless of the number
of successes, but they too are allowed an opposed Wits +
Alertness roll (diffi culty 7 for ghouls).",Blood Sacrifice: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,80
Setite Sorcery,Voice of the Wild (Wanga),3,Marring the Prey,"Working off the premise, “I don’t have to run faster
than the bear, I just have to run faster than you,” this power
allows the caster to fi x the attention of a given variety of
animal on a specifi c target. The beasts in question will
focus only on that individual, unless someone else makes
a concerted effort to get their attention. This power does
not automatically make an animal hostile."," The caster must have a bit of hair or other
sample from the variety of animal to be infl uenced, and a
pinch or drop of something that animal might fi nd attractive
(catnip for cats, the fur of a small rodent for snakes,
etc.). These must be combined at the time the blood is
spent to invoke the magic. The target must be visible to
the wangateur. If the roll succeeds, all animals of the chosen
variety in the area will focus exclusively on the target
for the duration of the scene, or until the target is able to
escape their immediate vicinity (and avoid pursuit) for
several minutes. Distracting their attention requires physical
contact or an actual attack; shouting at them accomplishes
nothing. Friendly animals will frolic and play around the
target, whereas hostile animals will attack.",Blood Sacrifice: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,80
Setite Sorcery,Voice of the Wild (Wanga),4,Guiding Spirit,"This power allows the wangateur to manipulate the
emotional state of an animal. This means more than just
“angry” or “sad.” The caster can achieve a specifi c degree
of control by causing the animal to react one way to some
stimuli, and entirely differently to another. Although not
as particular as the control granted by Animalism, Guiding
Spirit can create some truly impressive results."," The caster must have in his possession some
body part (again, fur or the like is fi ne) from the type of
animal to be infl uenced. The caster must make eye contact
or direct physical contact with the animal as he spends vitae
to invoke this power. The animal may resist with Willpower
(diffi culty 7) only if the wangateur is infl uencing it to do
something totally against its instincts or training (attempting
to make a loyal dog attack its owner, for instance). Animal
Willpower can be found in the appendix of Vampire: The
Masquerade. For every success, the caster maintains control
over the animal’s emotional state for a scene.
The target can be made to calm down, grow enraged
enough to attack a specifi c target, become playful or any
other emotional effect on which the player and Storyteller
can agree. The animal cannot be made to perform specifi c
tricks for which it has not been trained (like shaking paws
or fetching keys), nor can it be made to place itself in the
path of certain harm (though it can be made to take risks).
The exact limits of this power are deliberately vague, as
animals react on a much more emotional and instinctive
level than humans. It is ultimately the Storyteller’s call as
to what is and is not possible with Guiding Spirit.",Blood Sacrifice: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,80
Setite Sorcery,Voice of the Wild (Wanga),5,Mantle of the Beast,"The caster may assume a single physical characteristic
of an animal. The eyes of a cat allow vision in areas of very
low lighting (though not complete darkness). The claws
of a bear are suffi cient for shredding opponents, and aid
climbing to boot. The nose of a bloodhound can tell you
exactly where that snooping reporter ran off to. And though
Kindred aren’t built for fl ight, a set of wings will at least
break your fall, allowing you to glide to (relative) safety."," The character must have on her person a sample
(as above) of the animal whose feature she wishes to duplicate.
This power duplicates a single feature only. Thus, the caster
could not take a snake’s ability to wriggle through small places,
because that is a factor of the snake’s body structure and not
a specifi c feature; she could, however, take the compressible
ribcage of a mouse and accomplish much the same thing, as
that is a single physical feature of the animal.
Claws created with Mantle of the Beast do Strength +1
aggravated damage. They also reduce climbing diffi culty by
2. Wings require a roll of Stamina + Athletics against diffi
culty 7 to use properly. Kindred can glide for a distance of
100 yards per success rolled (further with a strong tailwind),
and she can safely fall almost any distance without taking
damage. A protective covering like a turtle’s shell or an
insect’s carapace adds 2 to the character’s soak pool; these
dice can be used to soak aggravated damage. Advantages
for taking other features are at Storyteller’s discretion.",Blood Sacrifice: Secrets of Thaumaturgy,81

a penalty of 1 die (leaving her companion with only a 1 die

The character calls upon Anubis, the mediator between worlds. He cannot affect wraiths or other sorts of spirits. As with the Hand of Khnum, the magician needs the victim's 'True Name' or a sample of her body and her mundane name.

The magician can also now affect inanimate objects weighing up to 5000 pounds, such as a car or a large speedboat."," To affect a supernatural victim, the magician's player spends two blood points and two points of temporary Willpower (that do not add successes to the dice roll).

Setite Sorcery,Divine Hand (Akhu),4,Hand of Thoth,"At this level of mastery, the magician can employ the Divine Hand against all sorts of spirits, including wraiths. Since spirits do not have corporeal forms, the magician needs the spirit's True Name or (in the case of wraiths) a relic of the deceased's khat or some object (called a Fetter) that was supremely important to the person in life, The lector-priest can also affect a spirit that she sees directly. The magic only affects spirits who manifest on Earth, or at least in the spirit world very close to Earth. The Hand of Thoth cannot reach spirits in their own realms.

At this level, the agician can use the Divine Hand against inanimate objects weighing up to 20,000 pounds. such as an armored limousine, a emi, or a Learjet."," The magician's player spends two blood points and two points of temporary Willpower to affect a spirit, and makes the Intelligence+Occult roll. For every success the magician inflicts one health level of lethal damage to the spirit. The magic only affects spirits who manifest on Earth or in the Penumbra or Shroud.

The transmitted magic can be a Discipline effect or another path or ritual power. For insatance, a lector-priest could make a person fall in love with her by pouring a love potion over a consecrated doll, or by the Presence power Entrancement upon the doll. The hand of Heka cannot transmit purely physical effects such as a Feral Claws or Quietus attack, but the Hand can transmit non-physical effects to objects, mortals, supernatural beings and spirits.

At this level of mastery the magician can also damage or manipulate objects weighing up to 100,000 pounds. Examples include a small house (or section of a larger building), a large yacht, a passenger plane, a boxcar or a good-sized tree."," The magician's player spends two blood points and two Willpower points to affect supernatural or spiritual targets. The player also expends whatever vitae the transmitted magic demands, and makes seperate dice rolls for the Hand of Heka and the transmitted magic. Either the Hand or the other magic might fail. To influence mortal or corporeal targets, the magician needs the Victim's True Name or something from the victim's body.

all Setites creates a bond between them that allows a
Serpent to communicate his thoughts to his servants

power allows the sorcerer to share news and information
with his network all over the known world, and set plans
in motion from hundreds of leagues away."," To use this power, the player spends one
blood point and rolls Manipulation + Leadership (difficulty
6). If successful, the vampire may communicate
with any of his progeny or ghouls, no matter how far
away. For each success, one target can receive the message,
although all targets receive the same message. The

ability heightens these qualities to the utmost, giving
their words a hypnotic sweetness that can loosen the
tightest lips and release a victim’s innermost desires."," The Setite must invoke this power immediately
after sundown. The player spends two blood
points and rolls Manipulation + Empathy versus the
target’s Willpower. That night, the Setite must seek
out her victim and engage him in conversation for at
least a half-hour. If the invocation was successful, the
victim lets slip one of his secret fears or desires, though

Setite Sorcery,Immanence of Set (Akhu),3,Voice of the Prophet,"In ancient times, the powers of the oracle could
change a mortal life forever, bringing even the greatest
heroes to glory or ruin depending on how they interpreted
the words of the god. The Setites were very often
the serpent lingering in the shadows of oracular temples
such as Siwa or Delphi, sharing the corrupting words of
the god with those seeking confirmation of their fears
or ambitions. When a Setite employs this power he
is supposedly communicating with his akh, lingering
in the otherworld and drawing on the supernatural
knowledge available there."," The Setite must invoke this power in the
presence of the intended victim. The player spends
two blood points and a Willpower point, then rolls
Perception + Empathy against the target’s Willpower.
If successful, the Setite delivers a cryptic message to the
victim that speaks directly to his deepest desires. The
nature of this message is determined by the Storyteller,
and may mean little or nothing to the Setite using the
power. The victim, however, will take the message as
confirmation of his secret ambitions, and will be driven
to acting upon them regardless of apparent risks or disadvantages.

complacent pawn into a raging madman (or vice versa).",Libellus Sanguinus III Wolves at the Door,106
Setite Sorcery,Immanence of Set (Akhu),4,Lord of Storms,"Long before his incarnation as a tempter, Set was
the god of darkness and storm. This ability allows the
Setite to summon up a sandstorm (or thunderstorm) of
ferocious intensity, blocking out the sky and driving any
sane person to cover, but allowing the Setite to move
about quickly and easily."," The Setite’s player must spend three blood
points and a Willpower point, summoning a raging storm
that blankets the area within a square mile of the corrupter
who summoned it. The player may increase the radius of
the storm by spending additional Willpower, increasing
the area by 10 miles per Willpower point. While the
howling winds and sand (or rain) are severe enough to
drive most sensible creatures to cover, the Setite (and
anyone in his immediate retinue) may travel untouched
by the raging weather, as though it were a calm, clear
night. The effects of the storm last for at least one scene
but can last much longer, at the Storyteller’s discretion.

movements of his enemies while making a well-timed
escape, most notably during the catastrophe at Tanis.",Libellus Sanguinus III Wolves at the Door,106
Setite Sorcery,Immanence of Set (Akhu),5,Dark Invocation,"For thousands of years, the people of Egypt protected
their tombs and treasure vaults with foul curses that called
upon the gods for vengeance. This ability allows a Setite
to lay a protective curse upon an object or place, or direct
a damaging one against a particular enemy."," To lay the curse against a person, the Setite
must know the victim’s name, and in the case of another
vampire, he must have a drop of the Cainite’s blood. The
Setite must first devise the nature of the curse — it must
have a single, specific effect and a specific duration, no
longer than a lunar cycle. The effect can be virtually
anything: let his strength wither like the parched reed; let his
mind be dulled as though by strong wine; let his tongue speak
nothing but truth; let the skin fall from his bones.
Once the curse has been devised, the player spends
four blood points and a Willpower point, then makes a
Manipulation + Occult roll versus the target’s Willpower.
If successful, the curse takes effect immediately. In
most cases, the number of successes become a difficulty
penalty for the target in appropriate circumstances. In
the case of a curse laid to protect a place or object, the
Setite must state specific “triggers” that would activate
the curse, as well as its effect and duration, and this
information must be inscribed around the place or
object in question.",Libellus Sanguinus III Wolves at the Door,106

Through this power, the magician makes her victim hallucinate about snakes. The victim starts by seeing a single asp slithering nearby. No matter what the victim does, the snake comes closer. If he runs, another snake drops down before him or slithers from behind the furniture. If he attacks the snake, it vanishes but another serpent akes its place. Before long, more serpents appear, and one manages to coil around his body... Although the snakes look real and deadly, they never actually bite. They can only frighten the victim.

Other people, of course, do not see these phantom serpents and might assume that a frightened victim is on drugs or has lost his mind."," The Charisma+Occult roll has a difficults of 4, or 5 if the victim didn not see the magician and the talisman of Sokar when the attack Began",Vampire The Masquerade - Blood Sacrifice - The Thaumaturgy Companion,26

Through this power, a magician renders a victim as breathless and mute as the dead."," If the player succeeds in the dice roll, the victim can neither breathe nor speak for as long as the vampire concentrates upon her. For vampires, muteness is a minor inconvenience; they do not, of cource, need to breathe. For a mortal, loss of breath can kill and deliver him to the netherworld in truth if the magician persists long enough. Mortals can survive a few minutes of suffocationm but immediately drop to Injured. For each turn of energetic action that a mortal attempts while suffocating, the player rolls Stamina+Athletics roll (Difficulty 6).

In that case, the victim can act for that single turn, at a dice penalty equal to the number of successes the magician's player rolled.

Setite Sorcery,Path of Duat (Akhu),5,Consignment to Duat,"The ultimate power of this path sends the victim's entire consciousness to Duat. For a mortal, this means death. For a vamoire, it merely means torpor - but since the victim is at the magician's mercy, in all likelihood Final Death soon follows anyway."," Unlike the other powers in this path, the magician's player spends a Willpower point. This does not add a success to the Charisma+Occult roll. The victim, feeling himself die, can also expend Willpower to stay active for another turn. While doing this, the victim suffers a -2 dice penalty to all dice pools, as if attempting to do two things at once. The victim's player spends another Willpower point each turn to keep the character alive (or undead, at least), but the magician's player does not have to expend more Willpower points to continue the attack. To survive the attack, the victim needs some way to break the magician's concentration or escape her line of sight.

rates a 3; the Mona Lisa, a 9.) The Setite must be in
the presence of the work when he uses the power. If
multiple copies of a work exist, only the one(s) in her
presence is affected. For example, characters watching
a television broadcast with her see it as repulsive, while

victim feels nothing but emptiness and confusion when
he sees or thinks about the second. Love Dies counters
romantic, platonic and familial love."," The Setite must be in the presence of her
subject to initiate this power. The player rolls Wits +
Manipulation against the target’s Willpower and spends
two blood points. Thereafter, the subject’s emotional
attachment — which must have been love in origin
— withers over the course of the next few nights. This

Setite Sorcery,Path of the Dry Nile (Akhu),4,Hope Dissolves,"The Setite’s victim subject can’t shake the absolute
conviction that a specifi ed goal he meant to accomplish
can under no circumstances be achieved. He rapidly
grows disheartened and indolent."," The Setite must be in the presence of the
subject at the time he invokes this power. The player
rolls Wits + Manipulation against the target’s Willpower
and spends three blood points. If the roll is successful, the
subject sinks into a deep depression over the course of
one day or night, and becomes distinctly morose. While
in this state, a character may only have a number of dice
equal to her Self-Control Virtue available for dice pools.
If she wishes to use her full dice pool, she must spend
a Willpower point to undertake that action. Although
this power is unlikely to drive a character to suicidal
depression, a character already predisposed toward that
end may fi nd the urge more compelling.

successes the Setite acquired. It may be cured through
therapy, drugs, etc., before this time period, however,

active antipathy for some leadership fi gure who affects
his life — a manager, a vicar, a king, a president, his
father — and reacts in order with his Nature against that

corpse, or a vampire. Knowledge of these deeds is key to
practicing the further powers on this Path, as Imbue with
the Grace of Anubis is predicated on understanding the
deceased’s crimes."," For each success, a different deed — from

Setite Sorcery,Revelations of Duat (Akhu),3,Pharaoh's Sentry,"Unthinking, unemotional, unyielding sentries are
the best guards a Prince could want, but to create them
a sorcerer requires a dead body and a dispossessed spirit.
Pharaoh’s Sentry creates an emotionless automaton who
forever serves the sorcerer’s edict, acting as a warrior and
vigilant guard with no moral qualms against killing, or fear
of dying in service."," When a sorcerer practices Pharaoh’s Sentry on
a corpse dead for a single night in a place a ghost haunts, a
fragment of the ghost’s soul moves to the corpse and causes
its reanimation. The sorcerer must have used Weigh the
Virtues previously to identify a spiritual hook with which
to snare the spirit. Each success allows the power to be used
on a corpse dead for an additional night.
The sorcerer’s edict must be a single sentence, i.e. “You
must guard this tomb from all intruders but me,” or “You must
follow this man to his house, and kill him inside.” Ambiguity
leads to grave mistakes. In the previous examples, “You
must guard this tomb from all intruders,” would lead to even
the sorcerer being attacked should he attempt to enter the
tomb; and “You must follow this man to his house and kill him,”
may lead to the victim’s murder at a premature point, rather
than inside the hoped-for building.
The animated corpse remains active permanently without
succumbing to decomposition.

return more than a flicker of life. By the jackal god’s grace,
a sorcerer taps into the good deed or sin identified through
Weigh the Virtues, and imbues the corpse animated through
Pharaoh’s Sentry with a compulsion based on that deed.
The animated corpse is still victim to the one-line edict,
but now harbors emotions and inclinations based on the
harvested spirit’s former deeds and will act on them when
not specifically directed to do otherwise. These inclinations
always manifest themselves violently.
The utility of this power comes through the chaos it
causes. A sorcerer who sends a horde of corpses possessed
by violent emotion into a town, knows the domain will come
apart at the seams."," A sentry with basic memory of its defining
deeds will act impulsively in ways similar to its former life;
i.e. a former murderer who cut the throats of merchants

neck, while a priest who assisted the poor will target the
homes of the wealthy, burning them down and massacring
the inhabitants. A single success plants the memory of one
deed in the mind of the sentry, with each additional success
giving the sorcerer the option to place another.
The spirit from which the deed is drawn for the creation
of this powered sentry is aware of its virtues or sins being
drained, but without the sorcerer’s aid cannot recover the

Setite Sorcery,Revelations of Midgard (Akhu),1,Bestowment of Scales,"Perhaps more than any clan, the Followers of Set value
the worth of their cultists. Many see little difference between
the status of a mortal, ghoul, or vampire, in service to their
god. This is a belief permeating the clan in all its varied forms.
For the love of their cultists, practitioners of Bestowment
of Scales may absorb harm dealt to their favored servants,
who gain patches of serpent scales on the flesh that would
have otherwise been harmed. These scales never disappear,
evidencing the grace of Set and the Midgard Serpent."," Bestowment of Scales affects any living creature
or ghoul from whom the Cainite has fed, no matter the
distance. When such a cultist incurs harm, the sorcerer
can reflexively apply her undead endurance to the cultist’s
body, the damage being transferred to the vampire. The
Cainite can soak this damage in the normal way, though any
damage not soaked by the vampire is suffered by the cultist.
The cultist develops scales in the place they would have
suffered harm. Depending on the location, this can reduce
the cultist’s Appearance rating, though Setites acknowledge
the deformity as a blessing. A botch on this power allows
the vampire to absorb the damage, but prevents her from
soaking any of it.",Vampire the Dark Ages - Tome of Secrets,65
Setite Sorcery,Revelations of Midgard (Akhu),2,Suffer for Jormungandr,"Above all else, the Followers of Set are a clan of faith.
Belief inspires its bearers with the ability to perform great
deeds, both noble and destructive. The Hall of Jörmungandr
teaches all its cultists to suffer for their beliefs; with sacrifice
comes reward. Those who give of themselves for faith will
surely receive spiritual recompense. Vampires who use Suffer
for Jörmungandr put this belief to the test, as for their own
survival, they bestow heinous wounds on their cultists. The
cultists suffering in this way gain serpentine features — a
narrowing of eyes, flattening of a nose, webbed fingers, and
loss of hair."," When a Cainite schooled in Suffer for Jörmungandr
receives physical harm, she may apply that harm to a
mortal servant from whom she has taken blood, and to whom
she has given vitae. The cultist must be within eyeshot of the
sorcerer. Suffer for Jörmungandr is activated reflexively unless
the vampire chooses not to use it. For each success accrued
beyond the first, the vampire may inflict an additional level
of the damage that she has incurred on her chosen cultist.
Damage acquired in a single turn may not be distributed
among multiple cultists, and any damage exceeding the
cultist’s health track will return to the vampire to soak or
incur. The manifestation of this power reduces the cultist’s
Appearance rating gradually, at Storyteller discretion. A
botch on the roll for this power still transfers all damage
to a cultist, but each point is converted to aggravated if it’s
not already so.",Vampire the Dark Ages - Tome of Secrets,65
Setite Sorcery,Revelations of Midgard (Akhu),3,Swallow the Tail,"The Hall of Jörmungandr believes in the pre-eminence
of the Midgard Serpent, fated to ingest its own tail until it
rears and devours the world. This strange power’s symbolically
similar to the myth, allowing the vampire to replenish
any blood spilt in battle. Whether pouring from a lesion,
staining clothes, or pooled on the ground — sorcerers are
able to draw the blood to them in dancing rivulets. Setites
are known to take grievous injuries, their vitae scattering
around them, before locking their foes in a hypnotic gaze
as the blood upon the earth crawls its way back into their
mouths like tiny snakes. Any cultists in the presence of the
Setite practicing this Discipline find the blood in their veins
bulging to escape. It does not, but forever after the cultists
bear snakelike blood vessels prominently marking their skin."," This power is always activated as the final
action of a turn, after Celerity actions. Blood within eyeshot
of the vampire slithers towards her, taking a turn to
reach her mouth and replenish lost blood points. It is the
Storyteller’s discretion how many blood points are in the
surrounding area, but each success rolled allows one blood
point to slink towards the sorcerer. On a botch, the power
forces the vampire to disgorge ten blood points minus her
Road rating. This power cannot be used to drain blood from
a living or undead vessel.",Vampire the Dark Ages - Tome of Secrets,65-66
Setite Sorcery,Revelations of Midgard (Akhu),4,Cycle of the Midgard Serpent,"The Hall of Jörmungandr places family upon a high
pedestal. Sorcerers know the importance of mortals and
ghouls; cultists sustain their efforts. As they drain blood from
the kine, the sorcerers return terrible, poignant gifts to the
cult as proof of their god’s pleasure. Setites who learn Cycle
of the Midgard Serpent impose one of the greatest gifts of
blood magic possible on their cultists — the ability to draw
on their masters’ Disciplines. Cycle of the Midgard Serpent
allows sorcerers to vicariously act through their followers,
though they have no control over how their cultists use the
powers imparted."," A Setite using this power may impart points in
Disciplines to a ghoul who’s consumed at least one point of
her blood. The number of Discipline points bestowed is equal
to the number of successes rolled. The power remains until
the sun next sets. Some powers are dangerous or actually
self-destructive if a mortal uses them. The Storyteller has the
final ruling on whether a ghoul can use a given Discipline.
For the purposes of Disciplines that require the expenditure
of blood points to activate, the ghoul possesses an
equal number of blood points to those consumed from the
regnant on the night the power is activated. A botch on this
roll results in the ghoul gaining the points in Disciplines until
the next sunset, but the blood bond to his domitor breaks.

Setite Sorcery,Revelations of Midgard (Akhu),5,Apep's Transformation,"To some carrying Set’s blood, their epithet as Followers of Set
is inaccurate. The Witches of Echidna did, in recent years, come
to the suspicion that while their founder may be a monstrous
demigod of capricious and devastating power, the name Set is
incorrect. Whatever their founder was, it posed as Set, Typhon,
Apep, and even the Midgard Serpent in efforts to achieve worship
and slavish adherents. Something in the blood of this Mother of
Monsters manifests through Setites using high levels of Serpentis
to change form. Apep’s Transfiguration allows a Setite to inflict
this change — one the Gorgons claim is Set’s true form — on a
loyal follower. The change is wracking, and painful, but the glorious
physique achieved quickly converts or consumes non-believers."," This power only affects a mortal or ghoul cultist
who’s imbibed the blood of the vampire sorcerer. On a successful
roll, the cultist’s body spends ten turns — minus the number
of successes rolled — contorting and shifting into a limbless
serpent, its arms and legs sloughing off as an amalgamation
of dead skin, tissue, and bone. The Apep cultist bulges into
a serpent form approximately the size of a destrier. It cannot
speak, but can understand its creator’s language. The change
into an Apep cultist is permanent. The serpent remains loyal
to the vampire as a bestial ghoul, still requiring regular doses of
vitae. Any Revelations of Midgard powers usable on followers
remain usable on the Apep cultist. A botch on the roll to perform
this power kills the cultist and provokes a frenzy test for the
sorcerer, as she’s presented with a humiliating failure of faith.
The Apep cultist has the following statistics:
Attributes: Strength 5, Dexterity 5, Stamina 4,
Charisma 3, Manipulation 1, Appearance 1, Perception
3, Intelligence 2, Wits 3
Abilities: Alertness 4, Athletics 4, Brawl 5, Intimidation

Theology 3
Disciplines: Fortitude 1, Potence 2, Presence 2
Willpower: 9
Health: 15
Notes: The Apep cultist commonly has a reserve of
ten blood points, and sinks into a torpid state without
blood. They can acquire further blood through
drinking from a victim. Apep cultists can soak all but
aggravated damage. Its bite attack uses eight dice
(Strength + 3).",Vampire the Dark Ages - Tome of Secrets,66-67

the induced compulsion. Whenever the target sees
another chance to repeat the triggering behavior, he

What’s the point of preventing addictions? Forcing an addict
to abstain, however, can shatter many habits and force a
complete lifestyle (or unlifestyle) change — not just an
easily visible addiction.
Temperance renders a victim unable to take pleasure
from satisfying an addiction. The physical or psychological
craving still exists, but the substance or behavior that once
gave such pleasure now provokes pain and disgust."," While the character is near the target, the player
rolls Manipulation + Seduction (diffi culty of the target’s
Willpower) and spends a blood point. The number of successes
determines the duration of the Temperance effect.
1 success 1 scene
2 successes 1 night
3 successes 1 week
4 successes 1 month
5 successes 1 year
The victim suffers one health level of bashing damage
from the nausea and pain of satisfying her addiction. Storytellers
may impose other problems, too, based on the nature of
the victim’s addiction. For instance, an alcoholic forced to go
cold turkey might need a successful Willpower roll to avoid
vomiting when he drinks. Storytellers may also wish to impose
withdrawal symptoms on those whose addictions would likely
produce such a result for “coming off the junk.”
The sorcerer’s player must select one and only one craving
for Temperance to affect. The character may use the power
more than once, however, to block multiple addictions. Temperance
does not work against true physiological necessities

Setite Sorcery,Soul of the Serpent (Akhu),3,Venom Curse,"The Tremere can transform her own vitae into a deadly
poison capable of blinding the eyes of nearby opponents,
like that of a spitting cobra."," The character coughs a point of vitae into
her mouth, where it transforms mystically into a deadly
blood-venom. The vampire then spits the venom at any
one opponent within range (equal to three feet per dot of
Strength + Potence). The player rolls Dexterity + Athletics
(diffi culty 7) to target the eyes, and the opponent may
attempt to dodge. If the attack roll succeeds, the target
must immediately engage in a resisted Stamina + Occult
roll (diffi culty 6) with the Warlock. If the target accumulates
more successes, he overcomes the venom’s effects
and retains his eyesight. If not, he remains blind until the
venom has run its course.

The blindness lasts for one hour per net success on the
resisted Stamina + Occult roll (that is, the Tremere’s successes
minus the target’s successes). Supernatural targets can
conceivably shorten this time. Vampires may spend blood
points to reduce the duration on a one-for-one basis. Lupines
will regenerate the blindness in short order, reducing the
duration to accumulations of minutes rather than hours. The
blood-venom is extremely toxic to mortals, however, who
are blinded for life unless they receive immediate medical
attention (within an hour). Thankfully, this supernatural
venom is quite thin, and its potency cannot be maintained

must immediately succeed in a Stamina roll (diffi culty
7) or die within (Stamina + 5) minutes from the snake
head’s virulent toxin.
If a mortal is killed in this way, the venom begins to
seep out of the corpse’s wounds shortly thereafter, carrying
the unfortunate mortal’s essence along with it. The bloodvenom
then pools nearby, slowly coagulating to form a
small supernatural asp under the control of the Warlock.
From that point forward, that mortal’s soul knows no peace

Setite Sorcery,Soul of the Serpent (Akhu),5,Form of the Hydra,"This powerful incantation — the ultimate plateau
of achievement for one studying this path — allows the
Warlock to transform instantly into a writhing mass of
vipers, her body erupting in a spectacular shower of black,
red, green and gold."," The player must spend two blood points to effect
the change, which takes three turns to complete. During this
time, the character may take no other action, and no transition
of any kind is apparent in her form. At the end of the turn,
her body simply bursts into a number of vipers equal to the
maximum number of blood points the character can hold.
(For example, an 8th generation Tremere using this power
would explode into 15 separate snakes.) Alternatively, the
player may opt to transform instantaneously, but she does so
at a cost of fi ve blood points rather than two.
Individuals assuming the Form of the Hydra are
nearly impossible to destroy. Every last viper must fi rst be
located, as the Thaumaturge may reform later if even a

Dur-An-Ki,Awakening of the Steel,1,Confer with the Blade,"Although few Banu Haqim claim to have actually spoken to a weapon’s soul, blacksmiths and warriors alike have ascribed spiritual qualities to hand-forged blades for centuries. Practitioners of Auspex are familiar with the manner in which inanimate objects can bear impressions of their own history. Confer with the Blade allows a weapon’s wielder to delve into the events that have occurred around his weapon. Some practitioners of this power claim this makes the weapon feel more “comfortable” in their hands, while others speak of the sense of history that an ancient blade bears. The actual impressions only take an instant to gain, though many prefer to spend much longer in contemplation if time permits."," The number of successes determines the amount of information the sorcerer gains regarding the blade’s history and its present state, as well as all information yielded by a lesser number of successes. With three or more successes, the sorcerer may lower the difficulty on his next attempt to apply a blood-magic ritual to the weapon by one.",V20 Corebook,441
Dur-An-Ki,Awakening of the Steel,2,Grasp of the Mountain,The best scimitar in all creation does its owner no good if it’s lying five yards away from him. Grasp of the Mountain strengthens the spiritual bond between the sword and the swordsman in order to reinforce the wielder’s physical grip on his weapon. A blade that is under the effect of this art never leaves its master’s hand unless he so wills it.," For the rest of the scene, the character has a number of automatic successes to resist all attempts to disarm him, equal to the number of successes rolled. He cannot accidentally drop the blade (which means his botches are likely to result in self-mutilation in-stead of an empty hand). If the character is somehow disarmed in spite of Grasp of the Mountain, he may call the blade back to his hand by successfully invoking this power again, assuming he has a clear line of sight to the weapon.",V20 Corebook,441
Dur-An-Ki,Awakening of the Steel,3,Pierce Steel’s Skin,"At this level of understanding, the sorcerer can com-mand his blade with such precision that he can strike at an opponent’s physical protection rather than his body. The sword transfers its full fury to the intended target, shredding even the toughest chain or plate. This strips away the victim’s defenses, leaving him vulner-  

Successes  Result
One success  Physical information only: precise length and weight (to the micrometer and milligram), chemical composition (assuming the character understands metallurgy), number of damage dice and type of damage (lethal or aggravated).
Two successes Historical overview: when and where the blade was forged, the name and face of its smith, brief glimpses of significant events in its existence.
Three successes Sorcerous understanding: the type and relative level of power of any enchantments or supernatural enhancements that the blade possesses as well as the name and face of the individual who laid them.
Four successes Subliminal synthesis: comprehensive knowledge of the sword’s history. For the next seven nights, the character recognizes the taste of any blood that has ever stained the blade if she tastes it herself.
Five successes Total communion: The sword and the wielder become linked at a level deeper than the physical and more enduring than the immediate. The Storyteller determines  what information the sword holds for the character, but it may include any event in the blade’s history or any aspect of its present existence and condition.able to the next attack. While this power is of limited utility in modern nights, as traditional armor has fallen by the wayside, it remains in the path’s progression of lessons due to its utility in destroying other obstacles."," While Pierce Steel’s Skin is in effect, an at-tack against an unarmored target inflicts half damage (rounded down). However, for a number of turns equal to the number of successes rolled, each successful at-tack the character makes against an armored foe in-flicts damage on the target’s body armor rather than in-juring him directly. Only metal armor can be damaged by this power. When the character makes a successful attack against an armored target, the player does not roll damage. Instead, he rolls a number of dice equal to the sword’s damage bonus (the number of dice that it adds to his Strength) against a difficulty of 7. Each success reduces the armor’s soak bonus by one die. Ar-mor that is reduced to zero soak dice in this manner is completely destroyed and unsalvageable. Additional successes beyond those needed to destroy a piece of ar-mor have no effect. At the Storyteller’s discretion, Pierce Steel’s Skin may destroy other inanimate objects (walls, doors, cars, dramatically appropriate obstacles) without significant damage to the sword. For the purposes of this power, Fortitude counts as part of the target’s Stamina, not external armor.",V20 Corebook,441
Dur-An-Ki,Awakening of the Steel,4,Razor’s Shield,"Many swordsmen hold that the duel is the ultimate test of the warrior because it places all opponents on an equal footing: Death is only three feet of steel away, and only the skill of the combatants determines who walks away. However, observers who are more pragmatic than romantic note that an enemy with a ranged weapon (be it bow, sling, or gun) has the advantage of strik-ing from much farther away than arm’s length. While Awakening of the Steel cannot completely counteract this advantage, this power allows the skilled sorcerer some measure of defense as the sword interposes itself between its master and attacks from afar."," For a number of turns equal to the number of successes rolled, the character may attempt to parry projectiles. This requires one action for each projectile that the player wishes to block, and the character must be able to see the shot coming (Heightened Senses al-lows visual tracking of bullets). Each parrying attempt requires a Dexterity + Melee roll, with a difficulty de-termined by the speed of the projectile. Thrown ob-jects have a difficulty of 6, arrows and crossbow bolts a difficulty of 7, and bullets a difficulty of 9. Each success subtracts one success from the attacker’s attack roll.Razor’s Shield does not allow the character to parry ranged attacks that do not incorporate solid projectiles, such as flame, lightning, or spat blood.",V20 Corebook,442
Dur-An-Ki,Awakening of the Steel,5,Strike at the True Flesh,"Although pacifists may find other uses for blades, a warrior knows that swords were created for one pur-pose: to carve an enemy’s flesh into bloody ruin. Strike at the True Flesh invokes the very essence of the sor-cerer’s weapon, reducing it to the embodiment of its very definition (or, as the more classically minded would put it, invoking the Platonic form) while sim-plifying its target to a similarly basic level. The results of such an invocation are usually devastating on both a philosophical and practical level as weapon and victim momentarily lose all supernatural attributes."," The effects of Strike at the True Flesh last for a number of turns equal to the number of successes rolled, and they end with the first successful attack that the character makes within this time period. The sword inflicts only the base amount of lethal damage that a weapon of its size and type would normally cause, dis-regarding all enhancements that it may have received (though augmentations to the wielder’s strength or speed, such as Potence and Celerity, still have their nor-mal effects, as do extra successes on the attack roll).However, all the target’s supernatural defenses (in-cluding Fortitude) are likewise negated — he soaks the attack only with his base Stamina. If the negation of his powers and defenses renders the target unable to soak lethal damage, he cannot soak the attack at all. Body armor does protect against this attack, as it is a mundane form of defense.",V20 Corebook,442
Dur-An-Ki,The Hunter's Winds,1,Scent of Deception,"The target of this power gains the ability to alter
her scent or eliminate it completely.","A successful roll means that the target either
leaves no scent that can be detected or tracked, or
she leaves the scent of someone else known to her.
A failure means nothing happens. A botch means
that her scent is more easily identifiable to others
(in addition to the other penalties for botching a
blood magic roll).",Rites of the Blood,159
Dur-An-Ki,The Hunter's Winds,2,Chameleon's Skin,"The target’s skin and clothing automatically assume
the coloring and texture of whatever he stands near.","For the duration of the scene following
the activation scene, the difficulty of all Perception
rolls to detect the target increase by +4 so long as he
remains stationary. While he is in motion, the effect
is negated, but once he comes to rest again against
a different surface, he can reassert the camouflage
with a successful Perception + Stealth roll (difficulty
6, or 9 if someone is actively searching for him at the
time). Any texture changes are illusory; the target
does not gain the durability of a brick wall just by
standing near it.",Rites of the Blood,159
Dur-An-Ki,The Hunter's Winds,3,Unassuming Pose,"The target effortlessly blends into any crowd of people.
Everyone present will assume the target belongs there,
including any pursuers.","If the roll succeeds, any observer will
automatically assume that the target belongs in whatever
location he is found. Those searching for him are incapable
of perceiving that he is an intruder. However, this effect
cannot fool technology, and anyone observing through
CCTV, for example, can spot him as an interloper.",Rites of the Blood,160
Dur-An-Ki,The Hunter's Winds,4,Whiff of Kalif,"The target of this effect generates an aura which is
physically intoxicating to anyone who directly observes
her. Those affected may experience a pleasant daydream,
or may just be left standing slack-jawed as the target goes
on his way.","If the effect is successfully activated, anyone
who observes the target during the rest of the scene must
reflexively roll Wits + Alertness (difficulty 7) or become
intoxicated for a number of hours equal to the ashipu’s
successes in triggering the effect. Affected individuals are
incapable of taking any action beyond staring vacantly
at visions only they can see or perhaps giggling from
time to time. However, any direct threat to an affected
individual immediately causes the intoxication to fade.",Rites of the Blood,160
Dur-An-Ki,The Hunter's Winds,5,Ghost Body,"As a particularly powerful effect, Ghost Body requires the
ashipu to expend three points of blood instead of the normal
one. When the effect is activated, the target becomes completely
invisible, inaudible, and intangible, and she can move freely
through any barriers other than wards against vampires.","If activated successfully, the target becomes
immaterial in nearly every sense. The effect does not make
her into a true ghost, and she is incapable of interacting
with wraiths or spirits while in this form. She is also
incapable of using any Disciplines while in this form.
The effect ends as soon as the target makes the conscious
decision to affect the physical world in any way.",Rites of the Blood,160
Dur-An-Ki,The Path of the Evil Eye,1,Humiliation,"The simplest application of the Evil Eye causes the target 
to embarrass himself in some public way. Possible results 
include saying something embarrassing in front of one’s 
peers, failing disastrously at a feeding attempt, or simply 
ripping the seat out of one’s pants while in a crowded bar.","Each success represents one night during which 
the target is affected by the curse. The curse triggers 
once per night at a time of the Storyteller’s choosing, 
usually the scene during which the character is in front 
of the largest number of individuals or in which he is in 
front of the largest number of socially important people. 
That is, it may trigger while the character is in a crowded 
restaurant or when he is alone with the Prince, whichever 
has the greatest potential for personal embarrassment. 
The Storyteller determines when the curse triggers, but 
it should do so at least once per night. 
During the trigger scene, on every Social roll made for 
the character, the player must add a number of automatic 
1s equal to the sorcerer’s rating in the Path of the Evil Eye, 
thereby increasing the likelihood of a botch on a Social 
roll. In addition, during the trigger scene, the Storyteller 
should roll a number of dice equal to the sorcerer’s rating 
in this path (difficulty 5). Successes mean that some 
external event happens that causes embarrassment to 
the character, such as a waiter spilling drinks on him or 
a car splashing him with mud. ",Rites of the Blood,161
Dur-An-Ki,The Path of the Evil Eye,2,Loss,"This curse affects the target’s material worth. It most 
commonly causes the target to be stripped of money, but it 
may also cause her Herd to diminish, or destroy a Haven. 
The curse can target any tangible asset represented as a 
Background. If the character has no suitable Backgrounds, 
it targets personal items of emotional significance. ","Within one week, the target loses one dot 
from an appropriate Background. Generally, the curse 
preferentially attacks Resources over other backgrounds, but theoretically any form of tangible Background representing a personal asset can be a valid target. The sorcerer has no control over how the Background point is lost or even which Background point is lost. The Storyteller may even choose to decide randomly. ",Rites of the Blood,161
Dur-An-Ki,The Path of the Evil Eye,3,Peril,"At this level of mastery, the ashipu may finally endanger 
her enemy rather than merely inconvenience her. The 
curse cannot directly harm the target, but it can create 
a situation in which it is possible for her to be harmed, 
whether at the hands of a drunken lout who takes offense 
to the target’s manner at a bar or a pack of werewolves 
who, by happenstance, choose to board the same lonely 
subway car as the victim. ","The number of successes determines how many nights the character is at risk. At the start of each night, the Storyteller must roll a die and, depending on the results, fashion an encounter for the targeted character. 
Dice Result Nature of Peril
 1-3  None. The curse does not trigger during this 
      night.
 4-6  Minor: An encounter which is not likely to 
    harm the character but which has a chance 
    to do so. A mortal tries to mug the character 
    while she is in front of mortals, or simply 
    tries to hold up a convenience store while 
    the character is in line paying for gas. A 
    bar patron takes offense to something the 
    character does or says and tries to pick a 
    fight.
 7-8  Moderate: An encounter with a significant 
    likelihood of at least some harm to the 
    character. The character is involved in a 
    car wreck or struck by a hit-and-run driver. 
    Stairs give way while the character is 
     climbing them.
 9  Severe: An encounter in which the 
    character is almost certain to suffer some 
    lethal damage. The character inadvertently 
    says something offensive that provokes 
    frenzy rolls in nearby vampires. The 
    building collapses while the character is in 
    it or a fire breaks out.
 10  Catastrophic: An encounter that is potentially deadly.    The character’s is locked out of his haven during the    day. The character unwittingly says something that    offends a pack of nearby Lupines.

 Nights on which there is no peril do not count against 
the ashipu’s successes; the curse will continue until the 
target has suffered a number of dangerous encounters 
equal to the successes or the curse is lifted. During any 
dangerous encounter, a targeted character has a chance 
to realize she is under a curse (if she didn’t already know 
it). The roll is Intelligence + Occult. The default difficulty is 9, but it drops to 8 if the character has Auspex or to 6 if the character has any knowledge of this Path.",Rites of the Blood,161-162
Dur-An-Ki,The Path of the Evil Eye,4,Enemy,"This potent curse causes the target’s friends and allies 
to turn against him, even as it causes the numbers of his 
enemies to grow. ","For each success on the Willpower roll, the 
target loses one dot of Allies, Contacts, Influence, or 
Retainers. This may reflect friends and allies who have 
become angry with the character and turn their back on 
him, it may reflect contacts and allies who are simply 
unavailable for a time, or it may actually result in such 
characters being injured or even dying due to ill fortune. 
Alternatively, the player may choose to spend some or all of the successes to give the target a new Enemy (as per the Enemy Flaw) who arrives to pursue a vendetta against the character. Regardless, the effects manifest within a week, and the player of the targeted character may neither regain lost Backgrounds nor remove the Enemy Flaw without learning about and neutralizing the curse.",Rites of the Blood,162
Dur-An-Ki,The Path of the Evil Eye,5,The Eye that Wounds,"The ultimate expression of this malefic path, the 
Eye That Wounds does not require time to establish a 
chain of ill fortune. It strikes immediately. The ashipu 
must make eye contact with her target and utter some 
exclamation pertaining to a characteristic of his. It can 
be praise or insult, sarcasm or fury, but whatever form it 
takes, the target is immediately struck with an agonizing 
injury that damages that characteristic. ","While the curse allows for flexibility, the default 
assumption is that for every two successes (rounded up), the target (or object, if the curse is directed towards a possession of the target) suffers one level of aggravated damage. Generally, even a single level of damage is sufficient to slay an animal or destroy most objects. If used against a mortal, this power will permanently maim him. If used against a Kindred, the curse will inflict damage shaped by the ashipu’s words. If she compliments his beautiful eyes, they will be burned and he might be rendered blind until he can heal. If she mocks his honeyed words, the curse might burn out his tongue and leave him unable to speak. This curse may be transmitted through an effigy, but the normal difficulty penalty imposed for using an effigy increases by +2 (see Principles of Contagion and Sympathy on pp. 133-135).

Dur-An-Ki,Covenant of Nergal,1,Maskim's Touch,"By touching the subject — or at least getting near
enough to touch — the magician causes effects much like
infl uenza: fever, nausea, sore joints and the like. This makes
the target slower, weaker and more frail."," If the Willpower roll succeeds, the victim loses
one dot each from his Strength, Dexterity and Stamina.
This loss lasts for one scene. Multiple Maskim’s Touch
attacks do not accumulate effects, either with each other
or with higher-level Covenant of Nergal attacks. Effects
will accumulate, however, with deleterious effects produced
by other Disciplines, such as the Scorpion’s Touch power
of Quietus.",Blood Sacrifice: The Thaumaturgy Companion,43-44
Dur-An-Ki,Covenant of Nergal,2,Breath of Ereshkigal,"Simply by drawing a breath and exhaling in the victim’s
direction, a vampire can infl ict disease upon her target.
The sickness can affect victims some distance away. Unlike
the Maskim’s Touch, a vampire can use the Breath of
Ereshkigal more than once upon a target."," The magician can attack anyone within about
50 feet. If the attack succeeds, the Breath of Ereshkigal
reduces each of the victim’s Physical Attributes by one.
The number of successes determines the duration of the
magical sickness:
1 success One scene
2 successes One night
3 successes Two nights
4 successes Four nights
5 successes One week
Multiple attacks can accumulate, further reducing the
victim’s Physical Attributes, but only if the subsequent attack
has at least as many successes as the previous attacks.
Thus, if a vampire’s player rolled three successes for the
ashipu’s fi rst attack, a second attack would strip another
dot from each Physical Attribute only if the player rolled
three or more successes for its effect. If the player rolled
four successes on the second attack, subsequent Breath of
Ereshkigal attacks would need at least four successes to
increase the effect.
A vampire or ghoul can raise Physical Attributes by
expending vitae, and so counter the Breath of Ereshkigal.
Raising all three Attributes back to their starting value
completely cures the magical illness. Then, however, the
attacker can start over again. Mortals must simply wait for
the curse to run its course.",Blood Sacrifice: The Thaumaturgy Companion,43-44
Dur-An-Ki,Covenant of Nergal,3,Nergal's Blessing,"This power cures mild diseases, and at least reduce
the effect of severe disease. The user touches the target
for about a minute. Nergal’s Blessing completely heals any
health or Attribute loss from the Maskim’s Hand or Breath
of Ereshkigal. It partly negates the effects of higher-level
Covenant of Nergal powers.
The Hand of Nergal cannot cure non-pathogenic
diseases such as allergies, defi ciency diseases, cancer,
arthritis or genetic disorders, although it alleviates their
effects for a day. It also does nothing for purely mental
illness (though it may help in cases of mental illness with
organic causes).
In countries that lack modern hospitals, ashipu still use
Nergal’s Blessing to buy favors and goodwill from mortals.
In “developed” countries, ashipu fi nd fewer truly desperate
clients — but they do fi nd them. AIDS is not the only
disease that modern medicine cannot yet cure."," Nergal’s Blessing can cure ordinary infections,
from acne to pneumonia, with a single use. Notably severe
or chronic disease like hepatitis or malaria might require
two uses of this power, at the Storyteller’s option. Really
nasty or intractable diseases like ebola or AIDS require
three uses to cure. A single use of Nergal’s Blessing always
suffi ces for illness caused by other powers in this path.
Successful use of Nergal’s Blessing keeps the subject
alive (or undead) for another night, no matter how severe
the disease, and palliates the symptoms. This applies to
non-pathogenic illness as well. Although the magician can
never produce a true cure in such cases, Nergal’s Blessing
may keep a sick person alive long enough for the target to
heal on her own.",Blood Sacrifice: The Thaumaturgy Companion,43-44
Dur-An-Ki,Covenant of Nergal,4,Nergal's Wrath,"This is real infection — the appropriate microbes appear
in the victim’s body — but the disease progresses with
unnatural speed. If the ravaging plague takes the form of
gangrene, leprosy or some other relatively slow infection,
its acceleration baffl es and terrifi es any doctor.
A vampire who achieves this level of path mastery
selects a disease as his personal form of Nergal’s Wrath. An
attack from one vampire might take the form of cholera,
while another uses yellow fever to kill."," Nergal’s Wrath works by touch. For each success
the attacker’s player rolls, the victim suffers fi ve hours
of the curse’s effect. A botch means that the caster suffers
the curse’s effects instead, for fi ve hours per 1 rolled, on
top of the usual Willpower loss. Of course, the magician
can use Nergal’s Blessing to try curing herself.
For each hour of the character’s illness, the victim’s
player makes a Stamina + Survival roll (diffi culty 8). Failure
means that the character loses one health level and one dot
each from Strength, Dexterity and Stamina. If the victim
receives medical care, the doctor can substitute his Medicine
Trait for the victim’s Survival Trait, but only the victim’s
Stamina matters in either case. If the victim can accumulate
fi ve successes before dying, Nergal’s Wrath ends.
A vampire can counter the effects of the curse by expending
vitae to heal the damage. That can mean expending
a good deal of vitae — and Nergal’s Wrath will not stop
just because it’s daytime and the vampire must sleep.",Blood Sacrifice: The Thaumaturgy Companion,43-44
Dur-An-Ki,Covenant of Nergal,5,Ill Wind,"location and people get sick. The disease appears natural.
It will not progress any faster than normal, but the illness
may be unusually virulent, and it can affect Kindred too.
The Ill Wind ignores most mundane barriers. Only magic
or an air-tight chamber can protect against the curse.
The Ill Wind always takes the form of a disease that
could plausibly occur in the area where the magician uses
the curse. Thus, an ashipu could attack a New York dinner
party with ptomaine, E. Coli or even legionnaire’s disease, but
not smallpox (extinct) or bubonic plague (not native to the
area). The Ill Wind’s user has no control over what disease
he calls, but every victim contracts the same disease."," The Ill Wind costs the magician’s player one
Willpower point in addition to the usual blood point. The
number of successes rolled by the ashipu’s player determines
the number of people affected:
1 success Four people
2 successes Eight people
3 successes 12 people
4 successes 20 people
5 successes Everyone in the vampire’s immediate
area (an entire auditorium, a mob)
If an area holds more people than the vampire can affect,
the Ill Wind infects the people with lower Stamina Traits
fi rst. The Ill Wind does not harm the magician herself.
The disease takes effect slowly (growing to full strength
at about one day per dot of Stamina for a victim). Once
the curse takes effect, the victim loses three health levels
and three dots from each Physical Attribute, to a minimum
of 0 — at this stage.
A victim has a chance of recovery for each day of
bed-rest, or sleep for Kindred. The victim’s player makes a
Stamina + Survival roll (diffi culty 7). If the roll succeeds,
the victim recovers one dot of each Physical Attribute.
Failing the Stamina + Survival roll means losing another
dot of Stamina. The curse ends when the victim recovers
all her Physical Attributes. As with Nergal’s Wrath, the
player of a victim under medical care can add the character’s
Stamina Trait and the doctor’s Medicine Trait.
Unlike other attacks based on Nergal’s Covenant, Ill
Wind does not protect a victim from the lower-level powers.
A sick victim can suffer further Attribute loss from Maskim’s
Touch, Breath of Ereshkigal or Nergal’s Wrath.",Blood Sacrifice: The Thaumaturgy Companion,43-44
Dur-An-Ki,Music of the Spheres,1,Song of Mercury,"This path calls for the usual Willpower roll,
but the character requires a Trait rating of 3 in Performance
— either singing or playing some sort of instrument — to
cast the Music of the Spheres. The magician can activate
the Music of the Spheres through a single turn of melody,
but everyone nearby can sense the occult power in the
music. The magician can conceal the celestial melody
within ordinary music, but this requires that targets hear
the music for at least a full minute. Listeners also receive
a Perception + Occult roll (diffi culty 5 + the number of
successes the performer’s player received on the Willpower
roll) to detect the unnatural force within the performer’s
music.
Each power affects a variable number of targets depending
on how many successes the magician’s player rolls, as
noted on the chart below. If more people are present than
the character can infl uence, the Music of the Spheres affects
those with lower Willpower scores fi rst.
1 success One person
2 successes Two people
3 successes Six people
4 successes 20 people
5 successes Everyone in the vampire’s immediate
vicinity (an entire auditorium, a mob)
The Music of the Spheres does not enchant people
who hear it in a recording, or transmitted by telephone,
television or other electrical or mechanical means.
If two characters use the Music of the Spheres against
the same target, the character whose player rolls the most
successes has her effect take precedence.","The music of Mercury, the planet that rules abstract
thought, deadens emotions. The swift cascades of notes
distract listeners and calm their souls.
 In game terms, the Song of Mercury negates the

Dur-An-Ki,Echoes of Allah's Wrath,1,Curse of Lifeless Mien,"The first, and some would say principal, aspect of the
curse on Caine was being stripped of his acceptance in
the brotherhood of Man. When a man is Embraced, he
is made dead to the world of men but forever forced to
dwell within it, as a stranger in his own home. This power
casts that same pall of ostracism over the target, making
him an outsider among his own kind. For those to whom
close social interaction is a requirement for daily survival,
this can mean a world of trouble."," The player rolls Road rating with a difficulty
equal to the subject’s Willpower. Success imparts a
curse of isolation onto the target. Mortals “darken,”
becoming sinister and withdrawn to the point where
even relatives don’t trust them. Cainites afflicted with
this power are struck by the weight of their lifeless hearts,
losing one dot from their highest Social Attribute.
Furthermore, any creative endeavor attempted during
the curse period becomes nearly impossible for these
undying embodiments of stasis (+1 to difficulties for
every success). More than one Toreador has succumbed
to despair after being smitten in this manner.
MET: Mortals receive the Negative Social Trait:
Callous, and will generally be poorly received even by their
closest friends and relatives. Cainites suffer the same effects,
as a well as the Negative Physical Trait: Lethargic, and
must roleplay the listlessness and depression of the true
realization of their undead state. Either type of target also

each Mental Trait spent on this curse.",Road of Heaven,70-72
Dur-An-Ki,Echoes of Allah's Wrath,2,Curse of Heavenly Dolor,"According to the Faithful, the curse of vampirism is
one brought down from on high — a physical and
spiritual damnation straight from the hand of the Almighty.
Upon his Embrace, a vampire is forever after
humbled by the power of the Lord, wherever he may
encounter it. This level of the Path echoes and imparts
that vampiric weakness to faith."," The player rolls Road (difficulty of the
victim’s Willpower). If the roll succeeds, the blood
magician can cause any target to become vulnerable to
the effects of True Faith as though the subject himself
was one of the Damned. From the moment of his cursing
until the end of the effect’s duration, the target takes
damage from holy items and holy ground and may be
repelled by anyone possessing and demonstrating True
Faith. (For a complete list of Faith effects, see Dark
Ages: Vampire, p. 289.)
Cainites afflicted with this curse find their own
vulnerability to Faith heightened. Difficulties against or
to resist the effects of Faith are raised by two for the
duration, and any damage suffered from the appropriate
sources is doubled.
MET: The caster makes a test of his Road Traits
against a difficulty of the target’s Willpower Traits.
(Each level of True Faith he possesses, if applicable, adds
one to his bid.) If successful, the target is affected by True
Faith just as though he were one of the Damned — he
may be turned back by the faithful, holy ground is
blocked to him, etc. (For more on True Faith, see Faith
& Fire, p. 256) Cainites afflicted by this power find
themselves at a two-Trait penalty on all tests to resist
True Faith, and suffer an additional level of damage from
all True Faith-based attacks.",Road of Heaven,70-72
Dur-An-Ki,Echoes of Allah's Wrath,3,Curse of Unfettered Rage,"Vampires are creatures of ferocity and instinct, driven by
a raging Beast Within. At this level of mastery, the practitioner
gains the ability to arouse such a beast inside others as well. This
force heightens the nerves of the subject, making him susceptible
to sudden onslaughts of instinct that force him into
mindless fight or flight reactions."," This power incites a force similar to the
vampiric Beast inside its subjects. This makes mortal targets
susceptible to frenzies of all kinds, whether the source be
from provocation or imminent fear of aggravated damage.
Creatures that already possess a “beast” of their own (such
as Cainites and werewolves) find their difficulties to resist
frenzy of any kind — and in the case of vampires, to resist
Rötschreck — increased by two. In addition, victims of the
Curse of Unfettered Rage gain the equivalent of the Flaw:
Repulsive to Animals (p. 309 of Dark Ages: Vampire) for
the duration of the power’s effect.
MET: Mortals affected by this power must test
against frenzy at most times a Cainite would be required
to do so, although they need not fear sunlight or test for
self-control when confronted with a large quantity of
spilt blood. Fire and other forms of aggravated injury still
provoke strong responses, however, as do any number of
ordinary provocations such as insult, humiliation or
attacks against loved ones. Storytellers may also wish to
devise additional uniquely mortal stimuli, or emphasize
any specific hatreds or phobias that an individual possesses.
If employed against Cainites or other creatures
already susceptible to frenzy, they are considered two
Traits down on all tests to resist frenzy for the duration
of the curse, and are two Traits down on all tests of
Animal Ken or other interactions with animals.",Road of Heaven,70-72
Dur-An-Ki,Echoes of Allah's Wrath,4,Curse of Boundless Thirst,"At this level, the beast unleashed within an opponent
has grown strong enough to demand actual blood
from its host. For so long as he remains thus cursed, the
target gains nourishment only from the ingestion of
blood; normal food will no longer sustain him."," For the duration of effect, the subject requires
living blood to sustain him (the equivalent of one blood
point’s worth per day, minimum). The blood may be from
any living source, and his body mystically processes the
blood and nourishes him in place of any and all other food.
If the subject ingests anything except blood during this
time, he finds it repulsive. He regurgitates it immediately
unless he makes a Willpower roll (difficult 8). Non-Cainite
subjects have the option of not “eating” until the curse
ends, but they will begin to suffer the equivalent of starvation/
dehydration after 12 hours without sustenance; in
addition, abstinence becomes increasingly more difficult.
Cainites afflicted with this power have all their
normal blood expenditures increased by one for the
duration. Instead of spending one blood point in order
to rise each night, he spends two; instead of burning two
blood points to activate his two Celerity actions for the
turn, he burns three.
MET: Mortal or other non-Cainite targets must consume
at least one Blood Trait’s worth of fresh blood per day
in order to sustain themselves; other food and drink provides
no nourishment and is immediately regurgitated
unless the subject spends a Willpower Trait. A mortal
target of this power may choose to abstain rather than
indulge this dark craving, but soon begins to suffer the
effects of starvation/dehydration – one lethal level of
damage every 12 hours which cannot be healed until
proper nourishment is obtained. In addition, for each such
period he chooses to abstain, he must make a Self-Control
test equal to a difficulty of one Trait plus an additional Trait
for every period that has passed where he has not indulged
his hunger. Failure means he must immediately indulge
himself as quickly as possible.
Cainites simply find themselves spending an extra
Blood Trait on top of the normal cost every time they
would normally spend blood, forcing them to hunt more
often or risk falling into a hunger frenzy.",Road of Heaven,70-72
Dur-An-Ki,Echoes of Allah's Wrath,5,Curse of Forbidden Sol,"Perhaps the most dreadful aspect of Caine’s curse was
God’s commandment that he never again walk in the light
of day. Those afflicted with this power gain the vampire’s
terrible sensitivity to daylight, turning otherwise sun-loving
individuals into nocturnal denizens of darkness and shade."," Non-Cainite targets of this power instantly
gain the vampiric vulnerability to the sun. If daylight
strikes the target’s skin at any time during the curse’s effect,
he suffers aggravated damage from it (as per the chart on p.
258 of Dark Ages: Vampire). This also has the effect of
reversing subjects’ natural biological rhythms, twisting
their favored activity cycles from daytime into night.
Cainites afflicted with this curse gain the Flaw: Light-
Sensitive (p. 309 of Dark Ages: Vampire) for the duration.
MET: Mortals and other non-Cainites afflicted
with this power suffer normal damage from exposure to
sunlight, just as though they were ordinary Cainites.
They also find themselves growing lethargic, needing
rest during the daytime and becoming active at night,
which while beneficial given their sudden allergy is
likely to incite all manner of rumors and suspicions from
their friends and neighbors. Cainites suffering from this
power receive an extra level of aggravated damage every
time they are exposed to sunlight, and operate at a one
Trait penalty in any areas of bright light.",Road of Heaven,70-72
Dur-An-Ki,Whispers of the Heavens,1,Map the Skies,"Though Europeans have not yet learned to navigate
by the stars, Cainite observers with centuries in which
to travel and watch the skies have made some progress
toward this goal. The first technique that a student of
this path learns is that of divining his location with a
mere glance at the stars."," The player rolls normally. The number of
successes determines how accurately the character is
able to determine his location. If he has access to an
accurate map, he can apply this knowledge to pinpoint
his location; if not, he simply knows his position relative
to known landmarks.

Dur-An-Ki,Whispers of the Heavens,2,Read Heaven's Plans,"Many diviners claim to be able to read the fate of
a place or person in the stars. This power allows these
effects, though not with the precision many false prophets
claim. The sorcerer is able to glean the approximate
fate of the ground on which he stands or the person to
whom he speaks, though this is less an absolute reading
than a hint of the most likely of many possible futures."," The character must be standing on the
ground or touching the person on whom he wants to use
this power. The number of successes determine roughly
how far forward the character’s observations reach. The
exact nature of the vision is up to the Storyteller, but
this power never grants absolute clarity. Instead the
seer typically receives a few images and a sense of the
emotions and time frame associated with them. Using
the power to determine the fate of a city which will in
fact be burned by the Crusaders on October 8, 1201,
but will be the region’s best producer of grain until that
time, might result in a vision of bountiful wheat fields
suddenly scorched by fire and trampled by horses four
years hence. As always with such imprecise prophecy,
the fate foretold is not an absolute certainty, merely
the one that is most likely if events proceed in their
present course.

Five successes One century",Libellus Sanguinis III: Wolves at the Door,68-70
Dur-An-Ki,Whispers of the Heavens,3,Call Down the Hunter's Moon,"“To everything,” says the Christian holy book, “there
is a season.” Natives of Taugast speak of “auspicious and
inauspicious occasions” on which to perform certain
actions. This power grants its wielder a sense of the best
time to act in a particular manner. Though the sorcerer
is free to ignore this divine scheduling, his chances for
success will be vastly increased if he heeds it."," The sorcerer names aloud the act in question,
from “the planting of this year’s crop of wheat” to
“Lucas of Normandy’s proposal of marriage to Katherine
of Bordeaux” to “the assassination of the Ventrue, Fabrizio
Ulfila.” If the roll succeeds, the character learns the
best night within the next season (three lunar months)
to attempt this act, or the best hour between the present
time and the coming dawn to attempt a more immediate
task. The choice of the moment itself is entirely up to
the Storyteller, who should work it into his existing
plans for the chronicle.
If the character does try to perform this task on
the indicated night or at the indicated hour, the player
gains a number of temporary Willpower points equal to
the number of successes scored on the roll. These are
tracked separately from his normal Willpower pool, and
any that are unspent are lost at the end of the night or
upon the successful completion of the task. This power
may only be used once to divine the best night or hour
for any given task — the sorcerer may not stock up on
bonus Willpower.
A small group of individuals (no more than the sorcerer’s
Leadership rating) may benefit from this power.
Each character must be aware of the rite and give the
sorcerer one blood point, which is destroyed when the
power is used. Every individual who so donated gains
the same number of temporary Willpower points as the
sorcerer himself, and the same rules and restrictions
apply to these boons.
This power may only be used on an extended,
complex task — it may not be applied to something
that can be accomplished in a single action (or with
a single die roll). The effects of a botch are left to the
Storyteller’s imagination, but will definitely include
a false message that prompts the sorcerer to act when
the stars are not right. Also note that outside circumstances
may conspire against the sorcerer’ execution
of his task on the appointed night — this power does
not automatically reschedule the summons of princes,
for instance.",Libellus Sanguinis III: Wolves at the Door,68-70
Dur-An-Ki,Whispers of the Heavens,4,Trace the Soul's Favor,"A diviner who knows the date of birth of a specific
individual has access to a vast array of information
on that individual’s history and destiny. By tracing
the position of the stars under which the subject was
born, the sorcerer can learn such diverse facts as what
trade he is best suited for, what his personality tends
toward, or what sort of ultimate reward is in store for
him upon his death."," The player rolls normally, with a +1 penalty
imposed if the character knows only one of the
subject’s name or date of birth (or date of Embrace, for
Cainite subjects) and a +3 difficulty if the character
knows neither. For each success, the sorcerer receives
one piece of information about the core identity of the
individual in question. Five successes give the sorcerer
clues to the subject’s ultimate fate (Storyteller’s discretion).
A botch gives the target a sudden realization that
someone is watching him; if he ever sees the sorcerer,
he will instantly realize that this person has spied upon
him before.
The exact nature of the facts revealed by this power
are up to the Storyteller, but they may include revealing
the subject’s Nature, Demeanor, approximate Willpower
rating, Road and approximate rating, notable Disciplines
or Abilities. Ideally these should all be revealed in
character, without using overt game terms. A subject
with Melee 5 and Politics 5 might elicit the response
“sword and state are as equally mastered tools in her
hands.” Such a revelation would require two successes

Dur-An-Ki,Whispers of the Heavens,5,Ripples on the Sea of Stars,"The pinnacle of this path allows the sorcerer to
cast his point of view far away from his physical body,
using the heavens as a vast scrying pool. With this
power, he may observe any events that are transpiring
under the same stars that he sees. Of course, even this
powerful divination has its limits. The sorcerer must
be familiar with at least one participant in the scene
which he wishes to observe, be it the city in which the
events are occurring, an individual who is participating
in them or a specific item around which they center."," The character must have a specific target
in mind, be it a location, a person or an object with
which he is at least casually familiar. If the sorcerer
has read the target’s future at least once before, either
with lesser applications of this Path or with some other
magics, the roll’s difficulty is reduced by one. The
scene that is being observed must be occurring under
the night sky, and must be within sight of at least one
star that the sorcerer can see (though weather does
not block this vision past the usual difficulty modifier
which it imposes). If the events are transpiring under
the sun or under a roof, the attempt simply fails
(though the Storyteller should still have the player
roll). The number of successes determine the clarity
of the image that the sorcerer receives, as well as his
ability to exert limited mystic influence over the scene
that he is watching.
One success The sorcerer can dimly see
the scene
Two successes The sorcerer can see and hear
the scene
Three successes All of the sorcerer’ senses
function with perfect clarity,
and he may use Auspex 1, 2
and 4 to observe in greater detail
Four successes The sorcerer can use all his
Auspex powers to affect or
observe the scene, and can
also use any other sorcerous
path power (though not a
ritual) to observe or analyze
what he perceives
Five successes The sorcerer can use any
Banu Haqim Sorcery power or
ritual he knows to affect the
scene, as long as this exercise
of power does not require his
physical presence at the scene
This power’s effects last for the duration of the
scene being witnessed or until daybreak at the sorcerer’s
location or at the site in question. While the character
uses this power, the player suffers a +2 difficulty penalty
on all actions that require the character to interact
with his physical surroundings. If an individual being
observed has Auspex, he receives a faint sense of being
watched from above. This is not enough to identify the
observer, though the paranoid unease it induces may
be enough to press the subject to take matters indoors,
away from prying eyes — and prying stars.",Libellus Sanguinis III: Wolves at the Door,68-70

Dur-An-Ki,Blessings of the Great Dark Mother,5,Memo,"The firstborn and eldest child of Lilith and Lucifer was 
their daughter, named ""Water"" after her motther's fond 
memory of both crystal streams of lost Eden and the 
vast oceanic depths in which she took shelter after her 
expulsion. In the oceans, she bore the first of her many 
broods and emerged from her exile more powerful than 
before. Mighty and deep are tthe powers of htat great pri- 
mordial realm, and might was the form that the Great 
Dark Mother took there. She lent the secrets and gifts of 
that form to her first child and eldest daughter, the drag- 
on whose wings blotted out the moon and the sun 
and the stars, and whose scales shone with all the hues of 
the sea, greatest of all the purifiers. The ashipu who calls 
upon the dragon who weeps tears of salt sings, speaks, or 
plays an invocation that allows her to directly attack the 
principal infernal or spiritual pact of her target.","The ashipu invokes the gift of the great serpent of 
the ocean, spending one blood point and rolling Perception 
+ Occult, with a difficulty equal to the current Willpower 
of the target. By so doing, she gains the knowledge of 
what impelled the target to enter into a bargain in which 
his soul would be forefeit. Each success rolled yields more 
of the pact, and any infernal investments or gifts that the 
target possesses. Spectacular success yields the True Name 
of the target's demonic patron and the opportunity to 
directly engage in a contested Manipulation + Occult 
(difficulty equal to it's permanent Willpower) roll. Success 
on the part of the ashipu severs the bond between the 
infernalist and their patron; success on the part of the 
patron allows hte bond ot remain intact. Failure of any 
roll in this sequence allows the infernality's patron to 
perceive the ashipu and derive substantial information 
about her through the contact.",The Black Hand: A Guide to the Tal'Mahe'Ra,87

Necromancy,----- NECROMANCY -----,,,,,,
Necromancy,The Sepulchre Path,1,Witness of Death,"Before it is possible to control the dead, one must perceive them. This power allows just that, attuning a vampire’s unliving senses to the presence of the in-corporeal. Under its effects, a necromancer sees ghosts as trans-lucent phantoms gliding among the living and hears their whispers and moans. She feels the spectral cold of their touch and smells their musty hint of decay. Yet one cannot mistake the dead for the living, as they lack true substance, and appear dimmer and less real than creatures of flesh and blood. When a vampire uses this power, her eyes flicker with pale blue fire that only the dead can see.Ghosts resent being spied upon, and more powerful shades may use their own powers to inflict their dis-pleasure on the incautious.
"," The player rolls Perception + Awareness (difficulty 5). Success allows the vampire to perceive ghosts as described for the rest of the scene (in the mortal world — seeing ghosts in the land of the dead requires Shroudsight, on p. 163). Failure has no special effect, but a botch means the vampire can see only the dead for the scene; everything else appears as shapeless, dim shadows. While the vampire’s other senses remain attuned to the living, he is all but blind in this state and suffers a +3 difficulty to most vision-based Percep-tion rolls and attacks. Ghosts notice the glowing eyes of a vampire using this power only with a successful Perception + Alertness roll (difficulty 7)",V20 Corebook,160
Necromancy,The Sepulchre Path,2, Summon Soul,"The power of Summon Soul allows a necromancer to call a ghost back from the Underworld, for conversa-tional purposes only. In order to perform this feat (and indeed, most of the feats in this path), the vampire must meet certain conditions: 
• The necromancer must know the name of the wraith in question, though an image of the wraith ob-tained via Witness of Death (see above), Shroudsight (see p. 163), Auspex, or other supernatural perception will suffice.
• An object with which the wraith had some contact in life must be in the vicinity, though it need not be something of significant importance to the ghost’s liv-ing consciousness. A piece of the ghost’s corpse works well for this purpose (and even provides a -1 difficulty modifier).Certain types of ghosts cannot be summoned with this power. Vampires who achieved Golconda before their Final Deaths, or who were diablerized, are beyond the reach of this summons. Likewise, many ghosts of the dead cannot be called — they are destroyed, un-able to return to the mortal plane, or lost in the eternal storm of the Underworld"," The player spends one blood point and rolls Manipulation + Occult (difficulty equal to 7 or the ghost’s Willpower, whichever is higher). The vampire must know the name of the ghost and have on hand an object the ghost had contact with in life. Provided that the target has died and become a ghost, success means the shade appears before the necromancer as described above. Not everyone becomes a ghost — it requires a strong will to persevere in the face of death, and souls that have found peace pass on to their eternal rewards. Moreover, it is possible for the dead to suffer spiritual dissolution and destruction after they become ghosts. The Storyteller should consider all these factors when deciding whether a particular ghost exists for a vampire to summon.Vampires know if their summons should have suc-ceeded by a feeling of sudden, terrifying descent as they reach too far into the great Beyond, so this power can be used to determine whether a soul has endured be-yond death. While a failure means the vampire wastes blood, a botch calls a spirit other than the one sought — usually a malevolent ghost known as a Spectre (see p. 385). Such a fiend torments the one who summoned it with every wicked power at its disposal. Once a ghost is summoned, it may not deliberately move out of sight of the vampire, though it can take any other actions, including direct attack. The vam-pire’s player may spend a Willpower point to dismiss the ghost at any time (unless he rolled a botch). Other-wise, at the end of the scene, shadows engulf the spirit once more and return it to its original location.",V20 Corebook,161
Necromancy,The Sepulchre Path,3, Compel Soul,"With this power, a vampire can command a ghost to do his bidding for a while. Compulsion of the soul is a perilous undertaking and, when used improperly, can endanger vampire and wraith alike."," The vampire locates and approaches the in-tended ghost or calls it to his presence with Summon Soul. As with the previous power, he must have the ghost’s name and an object it handled in life. His player then spends one blood point and rolls Manipulation + Occult in a resisted roll against the ghost’s Willpower (difficulty 6 for both rolls). If the vampire wins, the number of net successes de-termines the degree of control he has over the ghost (as described below). Moreover, the vampire’s control keeps ghosts that have been called with Summon Soul from returning to their original locations at the end of the scene. If the ghost wins, the vampire loses a number of Willpower points equal to the ghost’s net successes. On a tie, the roll becomes an extended contest that continues each turn until one side wins. If the vampire botches at any point, the ghost is immune to any use of the vampire’s Necromancy for the rest of the scene. If the ghost botches, it must obey as if the vampire’s player had rolled five net successes.  Successes   Result1 success The ghost must perform one simple task for the vampire that does not place it in certain danger. It must attend to this task immediately,  although it can delay the compulsion and pursue its own  business at a cost of one Willpower point per scene. The ghost may not attack the vampire until this task is complete. It is possible to issue the task of answering one question, in which case the ghost must answer truthfully and to the best of its knowledge.2 successes The vampire may issue two orders or ask two questions as outlined for one success. Alternatively, the  vampire may demand a simple task with a real possibility of danger, as long as the danger is not certain. The ghost may delay this compulsion with Willpower.3 successes The vampire may issue three orders as outlined for one success. Alternatively, he may demand the ghost fulfill one difficult and dangerous task or a simple assignment that has an extended duration of up to one month. The ghost may delay such orders with Willpower.4 successes The vampire may issue four orders, as outlined for one success, or   assign two tasks, as for two successes. Alternatively, the vampire may  command the ghost to perform one complex assignment that puts the ghost at extreme risk, or perform any number of non-threatening tasks as the vampire’s slave for up to one month (or, if the necromancer spends a permanent point of Willpower, for a year and a day). It is possible for ghosts to delay individual tasks, but not put off enslavement.5+ successes The vampire may issue multiple orders that have a sum complexity or danger of five successes’ worth. Instead, the vampire may order the ghost to perform any one action that it is capable of executing within one month. Such a task can place the ghost in immediate peril of destruction, or even force it to betray and assault loved ones. It is not  possible for ghosts to delay a task of this magnitude with Willpower — they must obey.",V20 Corebook,162
Necromancy,The Sepulchre Path,4,Haunting,"Haunting binds a summoned ghost to a particular location or, in extreme cases, an object. The wraith cannot leave the area to which the necromancer binds it without risking destruction."," The player spends one blood point while standing at the location for the haunting or touching the intended prison. She then has the ghost brought to her by whatever means she desires, though Summon Soul is quickest and most reliable. Her player then rolls Manipulation + Occult (difficulty is equal to the target’s current Willpower points if resisted, to a mini-mum of 4; otherwise it is 4). The difficulty rises by one if the vampire wishes to place the ghost in an object. As usual, the difficulty decreases by one if the necro-mancer has a part of the spirit’s corpse in addition to knowing its name (minimum difficulty 3). Each success binds the ghost within the location or object for one night. This duration extends to one week if the player spends a Willpower point or a year and a day for a dot of permanent Willpower. A wraith at-tempting to leave the area of a haunting must make an extended Willpower roll (difficulty 9, four cumulative successes necessary in a single scene) or take a level of aggravated damage for each roll. If the wraith runs out of health levels, it is hurled deep into the Underworld to face destruction.",V20 Corebook,160
Necromancy,The Sepulchre Path,5, Torment,"It is through the use of this power that powerful nec-romancers convince bound ghosts to behave — or else. Torment allows the vampire to strike a wraith as if he himself were in the lands of the dead, inflicting dam-age on the wraith’s ectoplasmic form. The vampire remains in the real world, however, so he cannot be struck in return. Torment allows the vampire to strike a wraith as if he himself were in the lands of the dead, inflicting dam-age on the wraith’s ectoplasmic form. The vampire remains in the real world, however, so he cannot be struck in return.
"," The player rolls Stamina + Empathy (dif-ficulty equal to the wraith’s current Willpower points), and the vampire reaches out to strike the wraith. Each success inflicts a level of lethal damage on the wraith. Should the wraith lose all health levels, it immediately vanishes into what appears to be a doorway to some hideous nightmare realm. Ghosts “destroyed” thus can-not reappear in or near the real world for a month.",V20 Corebook,160
Necromancy,The Ash Path,1,Shroudsight,"Shroudsight allows a necromancer to see through the
Shroud, the mystical barrier that separates the living
world from the Underworld. By using this power, the
vampire can spot ghostly buildings and items, the landscape
of the so-called Shadowlands, and even wraiths
themselves. However, an observant wraith may notice
when a vampire suddenly starts staring at him, which
can lead to unpleasant consequences.","A simple roll of Perception + Awareness
(difficulty 7) allows a necromancer to utilize Shroudsight.
The effects last for a scene.",V20 Corebook,163
Necromancy,The Ash Path,2,Lifeless Tongues,"Where Shroudsight allows a necromancer to see
ghosts, Lifeless Tongues allows her to converse with
them effortlessly. Once Lifeless Tongues is employed,
the vampire can carry on a conversation with the denizens
of the ghostly Underworld without spending blood
or causing the wraiths to expend any effort.","To use Lifeless Tongues requires a roll of
Perception + Occult (difficulty 6) and the expenditure
of a Willpower point.",V20 Corebook,163
Necromancy,The Ash Path,3,Dead Hand,"Similar to the Sepulchre Path power Torment, Dead
Hand allows a necromancer to reach across the Shroud
and affect a ghostly object as if it were in the real world.
Ghosts are solid to necromancers using this power,
and can be attacked. Furthermore, the necromancer
can pick up ghostly items, scale ghostly architecture
(giving real-world bystanders the impression that he’s
climbing on air!), and generally exist in two worlds.
On the other hand, a necromancer using Dead Hand is
quite solid to the residents of the Underworld — and
to whatever hostilities they might have.","The player spends a point of Willpower and
makes a successful Wits + Occult roll (difficulty 7) to
activate Dead Hand for one scene. For each additional
scene the vampire wishes to remain in contact with
the Underworld, he must spend a point of blood.",V20 Corebook,163
Necromancy,The Ash Path,4,Ex Nihilo,"Ex Nihilo allows a necromancer to enter the Underworld
physically. While in the lands of the dead,
the vampire is essentially a particularly solid ghost. He
maintains his normal number of health levels, but can
be hurt only by things that inflict aggravated damage
on ghosts (weapons forged from souls, certain ghostly
powers, etc.). A vampire physically in the Underworld
can pass through solid objects in the real world (at the
cost of one health level) and remain “incorporeal” for
a number of turns equal to her Stamina rating. On the
other hand, vampires present in the Underworld are
subject to all of the Underworld’s perils, including ultimate
destruction. A vampire killed in the realm of the
dead is gone forever, beyond even the reach of other
necromancers.","Using Ex Nihilo takes a tremendous toll on
the necromancer. To activate this power, the vampire
must first draw a doorway with chalk or blood on any
available surface. (The vampire may draw doors ahead
of time for exactly this purpose.) The player must then
expend two points of Willpower and two points of
blood before making a Stamina + Occult roll (difficulty
8) as the vampire attempts to open the chalk door
physically. If the roll succeeds, the door opens and the
vampire steps through into the Underworld.
When the vampire wishes to return to the real world,
he merely needs to concentrate (and the player spends
another Willpower point and rolls Stamina + Occult,
difficulty 6). At Storyteller discretion, a vampire who
is too deeply immersed in the Underworld may need
to journey to a place close to the lands of the living in
order to cross over. Vampires who wander too far into
the lands of the dead may be trapped there forever.
Vampires in the Underworld cannot feed upon
ghosts without the use of another power; their only
sustenance is the blood they bring with them.",V20 Corebook,163
Necromancy,The Ash Path,5,Shroud Mastery,"Shroud Mastery offers the Kindred the ability to
manipulate the veil between the worlds of the living
and the dead. By doing so, a necromancer can make
it easier for bound wraiths in his service to function,
or make it nearly impossible for ghosts to contact the
material world.","To exercise Shroud Mastery, the necromancer
expends two points of Willpower, then states
whether he is attempting to raise or lower the Shroud.
The player then makes a Willpower roll (difficulty 9).
Each success on the roll raises or lowers the difficulties
of all nearby wraiths’ attempts to cross the Shroud in
any way by one, to a maximum of 10 or a minimum of
3. The Shroud reverts to its normal strength at a rate of
one point per hour thereafter.",V20 Corebook,164
Necromancy,The Bone Path,1,Tremens,"Tremens allows a necromancer to make the flesh of a 
corpse shift once. An arm might suddenly flop forward, 
a cadaver might sit up, or dead eyes might abruptly 
open. This sort of thing tends to have an impressive 
impact on people who aren’t expecting a departed rela
tive to roll over in his coffin.","To use Tremens, the necromancer spends 
a single blood point, and the player must succeed on 
a Dexterity + Occult roll (difficulty 6). The more suc
cesses that are achieved, the more complicated an ac
tion can be effected in the corpse. One success allows 
for an instantaneous movement, such as a twitch, while 
five allow the vampire to set up specific conditions un
der which the body animates (“The next time someone 
enters the room, I want the corpse to sit up and open 
its eyes.”). Under no circumstances can Tremens cause 
a dead body to attack or cause damage. ",V20 Corebook,164
Necromancy,The Bone Path,2,Apprentice's Brooms,"With Apprentice’s Brooms, the necromancer can 
make a dead body rise and perform a simple function. 
For example, the corpse could be set to carrying heavy 
objects, digging, or just shambling from place to place. 
The cadavers thus animated do not attack or defend 
themselves if interfered with, but instead attempt to 
carry out their given instructions until such time as 
they’ve been rendered inanimate. Generally it takes dismemberment, flame, or something similar to destroy 
a corpse animated in this way.","A roll of Wits + Occult (difficulty 7) and 
the expenditure of a point of both blood and Will
power are all that is necessary to animate corpses with 
Apprentice’s Brooms. The number of corpses animated 
is equal to the number of successes achieved. The nec
romancer must then state the task to which he is set
ting his zombies. The cadavers turn themselves to their 
work until they finish the job (at which point they col
lapse) or something (including time) destroys them.
 Corpses animated in this way have no initiative of 
their own, and are unable to make value judgments. 
They respond to very literal instruction. Thus, a zom
bie could be told “sweep this room every day until all 
the dust and cobwebs are gone” or “transcribe this 
manuscript” with an expectation of reasonable results, 
while a more open-ended command such as “fix this 
motorcycle” or “research this Necromantic ritual and 
write down the results” would be doomed to failure. 
Bodies energized by this power continue to decay, al
beit at a much slower rate than normal. ",V20 Corebook,164
Necromancy,The Bone Path,3,Shambling Hordes,"Shambling Hordes creates obvious results: reanimat
ed corpses with the ability to attack, albeit neither very 
well nor very quickly. Once primed by this power, the 
corpses wait — for years, if necessary — to fulfill the 
command given them. The orders might be to protect 
a certain site or simply to attack immediately, but they 
will be carried out until every last one of the decom
posing monsters is destroyed.","The player spends a point of Willpower. 
The player then must succeed on a Wits + Occult roll 
(difficulty 8). Each success allows the vampire to raise 
another corpse from the grave, and costs one blood 
point. If the player cannot or chooses not to pay the 
blood point cost of additional zombies past a certain 
number, the extra successes are simply lost. Each zom
bie can follow one simple instruction, such as “Stay 
here and guard this graveyard against any intruders,” 
or “Kill them!” 
Note: Zombies created by Shambling Hordes will 
wait forever if need be to fulfill their functions. Long 
after the flesh has rotted off their mystically animated 
bones, the zombies will wait and wait and wait, still 
able to perform their duties. ",V20 Corebook,165
Necromancy,The Bone Path,4,Soul Stealing,"This power affects the living, not the dead. It does, 
however, temporarily turn a living soul into a sort of 
wraith, as it allows a necromancer to strip a soul from 
a living body. A mortal exiled from his body by this 
power becomes a wraith with a single tie to the real 
world: his now-empty body.","The player spends a point of Willpower 
and then makes a contested Willpower roll against 
the intended victim (difficulty 6). Successes indicate 
the number of hours during which the original soul is 
forced out of its housing. The body itself remains auto
nomically alive but catatonic.
 This power can be used to create suitable hosts for 
Daemonic Possession. It has no effect on Kindred or 
other supernatural creatures (except ghouls) until such 
creatures are dead – in the case of vampires, this means 
Final Death.",V20 Corebook,165
Necromancy,The Bone Path,5,Daemonic Possession,"Daemonic Possession lets a vampire insert a soul into 
a freshly dead body. This does not turn the reanimated 
corpse into anything other than a reanimated corpse, 
one that will irrevocably decay after a week, but it does give either a wraith or a free-floating soul (say, that of 
a vampire using Psychic Projection) a temporary home 
in the physical world. ","The body in question must be no more than 
30 minutes dead, and the new tenant must agree to in
habit it — a ghost or astral form cannot be forced into a 
new shell. However, most ghosts would gladly seize the 
opportunity. Should the vampire, for whatever reason, 
wish to insert a soul into another vampire’s corpse (be
fore it crumbles to ash), the necromancer must achieve 
five successes on a resisted Willpower roll against the 
original owner of the body. Otherwise, the interloper 
is denied entrance.
 Note: The soul can use whatever physical abilities 
(Athletics, Brawl, Potence) his new fleshy home pos
sesses, and whatever mental abilities (Computer, Law, 
Presence) he already possessed. He cannot use the 
physical abilities of his old form, or the mental abilities 
of his new one.",V20 Corebook,165-166
Necromancy,The Cenotaph Path,1,A Touch of Death,"Just as a necromancer may exert mastery over the 
Shadowlands, so too can some ghosts exert them
selves in the mortal world. Whereas obvious displays 
of ghostly power such as bleeding walls or disembodied 
moans certainly won’t be mistaken, some ghostly abili
ties exert subtle effects that aren’t easily recognized. 
A necromancer sensitized to the residue of the dead, 
though, can feel whether an object has been touched 
by a ghost or sense the recent passage of a wraith.","The necromancer simply touches a person or 
object that he suspects is a victim of ghostly influence. 
The player rolls Perception + Awareness (difficulty 6). 
If successful, the necromancer can determine whether a ghost has exerted any sort of power on the subject, or 
even crossed nearby, to the duration detailed below.

  Successes   Result
 1 success    Last turn; detect use of ghostly powers
2 successes   Last three turns; detect use of ghostly 
          powers
3 successes   Last hour; detect ghost’s touch and 
         use of ghostly powers
4 successes   Last day; detect ghost’s touch and use 
          of ghostly powers
5 successes   Last week; detect nearby passage of 
          ghost, ghost’s touch, and use of  
          ghostly powers

 On a failure, the necromancer receives no impres
sions. A botch reveals a misleading answer (an object 
may seem tinged with ghostly power when it’s not, or 
vice versa). Should the necromancer succeed in detec
tion while touching an object or person that a ghost 
is possessing, he immediately becomes aware that the 
ghost is still inside. The impression gained in such a 
case is sufficient to count as an image of the spirit for 
purposes of the Sepulchre Path’s powers, so the Kin
dred may be able to (for example) immediately com
mand a ghost to exit a person whom it possesses.",V20 Corebook,166
Necromancy,The Cenotaph Path,2,Reveal the Catene,"Necromantic compulsions function much more ef
fectively when the caster uses an object of significance 
to the ghost in question. Such fetters tie the dead to 
the living lands through their remembered importance 
— a favored recliner for relaxing, a reviled piece of art 
foisted off by hated relatives, or some object of similarly 
intense emotion. Many necromancers can detect such 
catene through the use of rituals (see Ritual of the Un
earthed Fetter, p. 181). With this power, though, the 
necromancer can determine a fetter with just a few mo
ments of handling. The Kindred simply runs his hands 
over the object and concentrates on it. He quickly 
receives an impression of the item’s (or person’s) im
portance to wraiths, if any; should the wraith be one 
known to the necromancer, he immediately recognizes 
the object as a fetter to that (or those) ghost(s). Suc
cessful identification of a connected ghost is not exclu
sive; that is, if the vampire determines that the object 
is important to a given wraith, he can also determine if 
there are other ghosts tied to the item, though he must 
use the power again to gain their identities.
 Many necromancers use this power on objects al
ready identified with A Touch of Death, in order to 
determine whether the ghost is trying to attune a given 
fetter or simply toying with the world of the living.","The necromancer holds and examines the object for at least three turns — if it’s an item, this means turning it over in his hands, running his fingers along it, or otherwise giving it a critical eye; with a person, this may require a more… invasive… examination. The player then spends a blood point and rolls Perception + Occult (difficulty 7). If successful, 
the Kindred determines whether the object holds any significance to any ghost and, with three or more successes, the identity of at least one such ghost (which allows the Kindred to use the Sepulchre Path on that wraith, if desired). If the necromancer already knows any of the ghosts involved, their ties are revealed with their identity — so, if the necromancer already knows a wraith well enough to summon and compel it with other powers, successful identification of a fetter tells whether the object is tied to that ghost, in addition to any other impressions gained.
 If a botch is scored, the necromancer can never successfully use this power on the item being examined.",V20 Corebook,166-167
Necromancy,The Cenotaph Path,3,Tread upon the Grave,"The extended awareness granted with the Cenotaph 
Path allows the necromancer to find locations where 
the Shadowlands and the living world come close. 
Often, the necromancer experiences a chill or shiver 
when stepping into an area where the Underworld lies 
near the living one. With practice, the vampire can 
tell exactly where such locations are.
 Experienced necromancers learn that certain loca
tions are susceptible to ghostly influence; these haunt
ed areas often become homes of a sort for ghosts. A 
knowledgeable vampire can thus discover places where 
the dead are likely to congregate, the better to snare 
them with other Necromancy powers.","The player simply declares intent to sense 
the Shroud in an area and makes a Willpower roll 
(difficulty 8). Success reveals whether the location is 
highly attuned to the Shadowlands, about average (not 
particularly close to the world of the dead), or far re
moved from the realm of death. A failing attempt at 
using the power has no adverse effect, though it may 
be attempted only once per scene (so the necromancer 
must either wait for a time or move to a different area 
before attempting Tread Upon the Grave once more).
 A botch stuns the necromancer into inaction for a full 
turn and costs him a temporary Willpower point, as he 
is overcome by shivers and a sense of overwhelming 
despair.
 With three or more successes, the necromancer can 
determine whether the Shroud’s strength has been ar
tificially altered in the area.",V20 Corebook,167
Necromancy,The Cenotaph Path,4,Death Knell,"Not all who die go on to become ghosts — many 
lack the drive to hang on after death or simply have no 
overwhelming needs that compel them to stick around. 
Normally, even necromancers have no way to sort 
those who might become ghosts from the masses who 
go on to whatever rewards await. Over time, though, a 
necromancer can become sensitized to the pull that oc
curs when a soul escapes from a body only to hover in 
wait, enslaved by its desires. The weight of desperation 
becomes like a tangible tug, and some necromancers 
savor this emotion even as they follow the sensation to 
find the new ghost.
 Of course, actually discovering the new ghost can be 
problematic. The Kindred may need some means to see 
through the Shroud or may have to send other wraiths 
to look for the new unfortunate, especially if a large 
accident or massacre leaves too many corpses for the 
necromancer to easily discern and test names. ","Whenever someone dies and becomes a 
ghost within a half-mile or kilometer of the necroman
cer, she automatically senses the demise (though many 
choose to ignore this “always-on” power unless actively 
seeking someone). This power does not automatically 
pinpoint the location of the new ghost or identify it, 
but the player may spend one Willpower point and roll 
Perception + Occult (difficulty 7) for the necromancer 
to gain a vague sense of the distance and direction to 
the new wraith. With one success, the Kindred may 
sense a vague pull in a general direction; with three 
successes, the necromancer can sense the direction and 
guess distance to within a quarter-mile or half a kilo
meter. With five successes, the necromancer immedi
ately senses the location of the new ghost to within 
one foot or 30 cm. A failure carries no penalty but a 
botched attempt sends the necromancer scurrying off 
in the wrong direction.
 The Storyteller may rule that disturbances in the 
Underworld, intervening magic, or other similar phe
nomena cloud this sensation, simply to prevent over
burdening a chronicle with constant ghost-hunting 
and dice rolling.",V20 Corebook,167
Necromancy,The Cenotaph Path,5,Ephemeral Binding,"The most puissant necromancers learn not only to 
sense the ties between living and dead, but to forge 
such ties themselves. The master of Ephemeral Bind
ing turns an otherwise mundane object or person into a 
depository for his own necromantic energy. The undy
ing Curse transforms the subject into a sort of linkage 
between the living and dead. The necromancer smears 
his blood on the item in question, which mystically ab
sorbs the vitae and, in doing so, becomes a vessel to 
anchor a spirit.","The necromancer must coat an object with 
his blood (a full blood point’s worth); if the subject is 
a person, then that individual must ingest the vitae. 
The player marks off the blood point, spends a point 
of Willpower, and rolls Manipulation + Occult (difficulty 8). If successful, the item temporarily becomes 
a fetter to one wraith. If the Kindred already knows 
the name of the wraith or has a strong psychic impres
sion, then the object can become a fetter at any range, 
even to a ghost who normally does not come near the 
living world (so long as the ghost still exists). Other
wise, the necromancer must be able to see or sense the 
ghost (with Witness of Death, Shroudsight, or other 
such means).
 A fetter artificially created in this fashion functions 
for all necromantic and ghostly purposes as a normal 
fetter: It can be detected with other Necromancy pow
ers, the vampire gains a bonus to Necromancy against 
the wraith attuned to it, and the ghost similarly finds 
exertion of its powers easier upon the subject (so the 
vampire might turn an unwitting ghoul into a consort 
for a wraith familiar with possession…). The ghost can 
sink into the fetter to heal; conversely, if the fetter is 
destroyed, the wraith is banished to some inaccessible 
region of the Underworld, perhaps never to return.
 A fetter created with Ephemeral Binding lasts for 
one night per success scored. The expenditure of an ad
ditional point of Willpower increases this duration to 
a week per success, whereas spending a permanent dot 
of Willpower extends the duration to a year and a day.
 Botching with this power not only causes failure but 
also makes the ghost immediately aware of what the 
necromancer was trying to do. Most ghosts do not take 
kindly to meddling Kindred trying to make artificial 
chains for them.",V20 Corebook,168
Necromancy,The Corpse in the Monster,1,Masque of Death,"The character with this ability can assume a visage 
of death or inflict that shape on another vampire. The 
victim’s flesh becomes pallid and thin (if it is not al
ready), and skin pulls tight against bone. This ability 
can be very useful, as it allows one to hide in plain sight 
in a tomb or crypt at any time (though the character 
remains as vulnerable to sunlight and fire as ever). 
When a necromancer uses this power on another Kin
dred, the victim gains the same corpselike demeanor. 
In this sense, the ability works as something of a minor 
curse.","The player spends one blood point for the 
character to gain the form described. Those afflicted 
with the Masque of Death lose two points of Dexter
ity and Appearance (minimum of 1 in Dexterity and 
0 in Appearance) for the duration of the power. The 
player also gets two extra dice to his Intimidation dice 
pool, should he wish to terrify any onlookers. Further, 
if the character remains perfectly still, observers must 
roll five successes on a Perception + Medicine roll (difficulty 7) to distinguish the character from a normal 
corpse. The player doesn’t need to roll anything to 
have the character stop moving — vampires have no 
autonomic functions. 
If the user inflicts Masque of Death on another vam
pire, he must spend a blood point, touch the target, and 
then make a Stamina + Medicine roll (difficulty equal 
to the target’s Stamina + 3). The Masque of Death lasts 
until the next sunset, unless the character who created 
the masque wishes to extinguish its effects earlier. ",V20 Corebook,168-169
Necromancy,The Corpse in the Monster,2,Cold of the Grave,"The dead feel no pain, though most undead do. With 
this ability, the character can temporarily take on the 
unfeeling semblance of the dead, in order to protect 
herself from physical and emotional harm. When as
suming the Cold of the Grave, the vampire’s skin be
comes unusually cold. When she speaks, her breath 
mists even in warm air — those with exceptional sens
es might even see a slight red tinge to the breath.
 The power brings a sense of lethargy over the char
acter, as a mortal might feel under the influence of a 
mildly unpleasant disease. It becomes difficult to rouse 
oneself to action, and very little seems important 
enough to really worry about. A corpse has no worries, 
after all.","The player spends one Willpower point. 
For the remainder of the scene, the character takes no 
wound penalties, and the player gains an additional die 
to all dice pools that involve resisting emotional ma
nipulation, such as Intimidation or Empathy. However, 
the player also loses a die from dice pools to emotion
ally manipulate others. The character is a cold fish to 
those she interacts with, and they do not respond read
ily to her. The Cold of the Grave does not protect the 
character against the depredations of the Beast. She 
may be emotionally cold on the surface, but if others 
taunt and anger her sufficiently, she is still subject to 
frenzy as normal.",V20 Corebook,169
Necromancy,The Corpse in the Monster,3,Curse of Life,"The Curse of Life inflicts some of the undesirable 
traits of the living upon the undead, removing their corpselike nature and creating a false life to remind 
them of the worst things about being alive. Targets of 
this power regain only the unpleasant aspects of life, as 
culled from the memory of the Discipline’s user. This 
may include mundane hunger and thirst, sweat and 
other excretions, the need to urinate and defecate, a 
decrease in sensory acuity, and a particular vulnerabil
ity to attacks that the character might normally shrug 
off.","The player spends one Willpower and rolls 
Intelligence + Medicine (difficulty 8) to affect a target 
within line of sight and no farther than 20 yards or me
ters from the character. If the roll succeeds, the target 
suffers the weaknesses of the living without gaining any 
benefit from that state. He does not become immune 
to sunlight or holy artifacts, for instance. However, he 
does become badly distracted by mundane needs, with 
the net result that his player suffers a +2 difficulty pen
alty to all rolls. He can ignore these distractions at the 
cost of one Willpower point per scene. Additionally, 
the victim cannot use blood to raise his Physical At
tributes while this power is in effect, and Willpower 
cannot eliminate this penalty. The power remains in 
effect until the next sunset.",V20 Corebook,169
Necromancy,The Corpse in the Monster,4,Gift of the Corpse,"This power, one of the most potent on the Corpse 
in the Monster path, enables a necromancer to ignore 
most of her race’s inherent weaknesses for a short time. 
A dead body is not particularly vulnerable to sunlight, 
holy artifacts, frenzy, or being staked through the heart, 
after all, and so it is with a vampire using the Gift of 
the Corpse. As with the Cold of the Grave, above, 
the character using this power takes on an even more 
deathlike mien. It lasts for less than a minute, typical
ly, but that time may be enough to enable a character 
to charge through a burning building without fearing 
frenzy or instant death.","The player spends one Willpower and rolls 
Stamina + Occult (difficulty 8). For every success, the 
character can spend one turn in a state in which he is 
more akin to an animated corpse than a vampire. Holy 
artifacts and sanctified ground have no effect, and the 
character is immune to frenzy and Rötschreck. Sun
light does only bashing damage, and then only if bare 
skin is exposed on a clear day. Being staked through 
the heart is only as much of a danger as getting stabbed 
through his dead spleen would be. Fire harms him only 
as it would a mortal — causing lethal damage instead 
of aggravated. 
Should the character end the power’s duration while 
exposed to any of the aforementioned harmful things, 
he immediately takes their full effect. If he is staked, he 
become immobilized; if he is on or near fire, he begins 
to take the damage a Cainite should take, and he must 
immediately roll against Rötschreck.",V20 Corebook,169-170
Necromancy,The Corpse in the Monster,5,Gift of Life,"With the Gift of Life, the character can experience 
the best and most positive things about being alive. The 
overwhelming hunger for blood temporarily abates, al
lowing the character to consume and enjoy food and 
drink. She can also enjoy sex as she wishes, and the sun 
does not burn her. The Gift of Life comes with a dark, 
terrible cost, however. Its use is almost sure to result in 
the death of a mortal, as the vampire must expend an 
enormous quantity of vitae in order to initiate it. The 
Discipline’s effects last until the midnight after the 
character uses the power, so it is in her best interests to 
use it just after midnight.","The player spends 12 blood points, burning 
as much blood as possible each turn until she meets 
that level. She then rolls Stamina + Occult (difficulty 
6) and needs only one success for the power to work. 
A botch has catastrophic effects. The character might 
be instantly killed or might inadvertently Embrace her 
victim, for example. If it takes longer than one turn 
to spend the necessary blood to enact this ability, it 
does not take effect until all 12 points have been spent. 
However, the blood must be spent continuously — the 
vampire cannot burn five, run off and feed, then burn 
seven more an hour later. On the other hand, she may 
feed as she activates the power — in one turn she might 
burn one blood point while drinking three. Since few 
Kindred above the Seventh Generation can easily ex
pend such an amount of blood, the most efficient way 
to activate this power is to have a human nearby who 
can be sacrificed to power the transformation.
 After her transformation, the character gains many 
traits of an ordinary human. She is largely immune to 
the scorching effects of the sun (Fortitude difficulties 
to soak damage from direct sunlight are halved, and 
she takes no damage if she is sufficiently covered), and 
she can experience and enjoy many of the fine things 
about human life. She retains a few of her vampiric 
benefits, however. Fortitude and Auspex abilities re
main in place if she has either of those Disciplines, and 
the Storyteller may allow her to retain other Disciplines 
as well if he deems them dramatically appropriate. She 
also retains a vampire’s benefits when it comes to han
dling bashing damage. However, she is still vulnerable 
to holy artifacts, human faith, and being staked. Her 
blood remains vitae, not human blood. Use of this abil
ity — which creates a mockery of human life — may 
interfere with a character’s Path advancement, at the 
Storyteller’s discretion.
 The vampire is no more vulnerable to fire than any 
other mortal while in this half-alive state, but she still 
suffers somewhat from the Beast. Frenzy and Rötschreck 
difficulties are halved (round up). She can remain ac
tive during the day without Humanity or Path-based 
dice pool caps, although she is certainly tired during 
the day, since that is not her usual time of activity.
 Her Beast exacts a dangerous retribution when her 
day of “life” is done. Although its influence is greatly 
suppressed during this power’s duration, the Beast has 
its way with the vampire for the next six nights, as all 
difficulties to resist frenzy increase by three. The wise 
necromancer hides herself away somewhere during 
that period, but, depending on morality and tempera
ment, enforced isolation might drive her to frenzy on 
its own.",V20 Corebook,170-171
Necromancy,The Grave's Decay,1,Destroy the Husk,"Cainites who kill their victims, rather than just feed
ing upon them, frequently find themselves in need of a 
quick way to dispose of a corpse. While there are many 
ways to make sure that a corpse is not found — feed it 
to a pack of hounds or weigh it down and throw it in a 
river — many of these methods do involve risk to the 
vampire and are not guaranteed to succeed. Destroy 
the Husk, by contrast, is foolproof. Use of this power 
simply turns one human corpse to a pile of about 30 
pounds (13 kilograms) of unremarkable dust, roughly 
the size and shape of that body. ","The player spends one blood point as the 
vampire drips her vitae onto the corpse. The player 
then rolls Intelligence + Medicine (difficulty 6). One 
success is all that is needed to render the corpse into 
dust, although the process takes a number of turns 
equal to five minus the successes. ",V20 Corebook,171
Necromancy,The Grave's Decay,2,Rigor Mortis,"One of the first changes that comes over a dead body 
is rigidity; the corpse becomes stiff as a board, frozen 
in a single pose. The Cainite who wields Rigor Mortis 
is able to push a living or undead body to that frozen 
point using only his will and understanding of the forc
es of decay. She forces her target to become rigid and 
unable to move without enormous effort of will, as his 
very muscles betray him.","The player spends a point of Willpower and 
rolls Intelligence + Medicine (difficulty 7). Each suc
cess freezes the target in place for one turn. A failure 
simply indicates the loss of the Willpower point, while 
a botch renders the target immune to powers in the 
Grave’s Decay path for the next 24 hours. The target 
must be visible and within about 25 yards or meters for 
this ability to take effect. A frozen target is treated as 
though he has been staked (see p. 280). With a Will
power roll (difficulty 7) and two successes, the target 
can break out of the rigor on her turn. Failure causes 
her a level of bashing damage and means another turn 
wasted and frozen.",V20 Corebook,171
Necromancy,The Grave's Decay,3,Wither,"Reminiscent of some of the powers of Vicissitude, 
Wither allows a vampire to cripple an opponent’s limb. 
Whether the foe is living or undead, muscle shrivels 
away, skin peels, and bone becomes brittle. The tar
get is unable to exert any noteworthy strength in the 
crippled limb. This injury lasts for far longer than most 
injuries trouble vampires, and in mortals it simply does 
not heal.
Wither doesn’t have to be used on a limb, although 
that is its usual purpose. It can also be used simply to 
affect the target’s face and hair, making him appear far 
older than his years. It could also be applied to a tar
get’s eye or ear, killing the sense in that organ (and 
thus requiring two uses to permanently blind or deaf
en). Wither cannot be used as an “instant-kill” power 
— necromancers cannot wither internal organs — but 
it can inflict a wide variety of injuries on a foe.","The player spends a Willpower point. The 
character chooses a limb on the target and then touch
es that limb. If the target is trying to avoid contact, the 
invoker’s player rolls Dexterity + Brawl to hit as nor
mal. If the character succeeds in touching the intended 
limb, the target suffers two aggravated wounds. Unless 
the target soaks both wounds (such as with Fortitude), 
the struck limb is crippled and unusable until both of 
those wounds have healed. Kindred heal the wounds as they would any other aggravated wound (see p. 285). 
Mortals are incapable of healing aggravated wounds, so 
they suffer throughout their lives unless they are healed 
through supernatural means. A withered limb does not 
degenerate further, even on a mortal. The character 
may be crippled for life, but the limb won’t become 
infected or gangrenous.
 The effects of the withering depend on the affected 
limb. A crippled arm has a Strength of 0, cannot ben
efit from Potence, and cannot carry anything heavier 
than about half a pound (200 grams). A crippled leg 
prevents the character from moving faster than a stut
tering hop or dragging limp. The character suffers the 
effects of the Lame Flaw (see p. 482). A single withered 
eye or ear imposes a +1 difficulty to relevant Perception 
rolls. Losing both eyes or both ears imposes the effects 
of the Blind or Deaf Flaws (see pp. 484 and 483). A 
withered tongue imposes the effects of the Mute Flaw 
(p. 483), while a withered face reduces the target’s Appearance by one for each aggravated wound suffered.",V20 Corebook,171-172
Necromancy,The Grave's Decay,4,Corrupt the Undead Flesh,"Corrupt the Undead Flesh blurs the line between life 
and undeath, turning an undead creature into some
thing just living enough to carry and suffer from dis
ease. The disease inflicts the target, causing lethargy, 
dizziness, loss of strength, clumsiness, and the inabil
ity to keep blood in his system. This pernicious influ
ence is extremely virulent among mortals. They pick 
the disease up simply by spending a few hours near the 
victim. Other vampires have a harder time acquiring 
the disease. They must consume the victim’s blood to 
do so, but afterward, they suffer just as much as the 
original target — including passing the affliction on 
to others.
 The disease fades after roughly a week.","The player chooses a target within her 
character’s line of sight and no more than 20 yards or 
meters away. She rolls Intelligence + Medicine (diffi
culty 6) and spends a point of Willpower. The victim’s 
player must roll Stamina (+ Fortitude, if appropriate) 
against a difficulty equal to the attacker’s Willpower. If 
the player scores more successes than the victim, he ac
quires a virulent disease immediately. The disease has 
the following effects: 
• The victim’s Strength and Wits are halved (round 
down).
 • The victim loses one point of Dexterity.
 • The victim’s player must spend one additional 
blood point every evening for the vampire to rouse 
himself to consciousness. Mortals lose one health level 
per day instead.
 • The victim’s player must roll Self-Control or In
stinct each time the character feeds (difficulty 8). On 
a failure, the vampire cannot keep the blood he just 
ingested inside his body, and he vomits it up in great 
horrifying gouts of gore, losing any benefit the blood 
might have provided. Humans vomit up food.
 Every evening at sunset, the victim has a chance to 
throw off the plague. The victim’s player rolls Stamina, 
with a difficulty equal to 10 minus the number of sun
sets since acquiring the plague. On a successful roll, the 
character fights the disease to a standstill and begins 
to recover. He instantly regains his ability to manage 
blood, and he heals back one lost Attribute point per 
hour until all have returned.",V20 Corebook,172
Necromancy,The Grave's Decay,5,Dissolve the Flesh,"This ability brings the Grave’s Decay path full circle, 
as it causes Destroy the Husk to apply to vampires. Dis
solve the Flesh allows a necromancer to attempt to 
turn vampiric flesh to dust or ash, as though the target 
had been burned or left out in the sun.","The player spends two blood points and a 
Willpower point as the vampire extracts a quantity of 
her vitae charged with the power of the grave. If she 
drips it onto a single Kindred victim anytime within 
the next few turns (most of the blood must reach the 
victim, so flinging a few drops is ineffective), it causes 
whole chunks of the victim’s body to crumble to ash. 
The player rolls Willpower against a difficulty of the 
victim’s Stamina + 3. For every success, the target 
takes one aggravated wound. 
The undead flesh damaged by this power turns to 
dust (gone for the time being), and it must be regen
erated painstakingly by the victim, should he survive. 
That dust doubtlessly has mystical properties that vari
ous sorcerers might be able to take advantage of. Every 
wound inflicted by this ability represents the loss of 
about one-eighth of the target’s weight; the Storyteller 
chooses where the loss comes from. (It might also be 
shed from all over, leaving the victim a bit gaunter or 
missing chunks of flesh.)
 Regenerating body parts occurs naturally while heal
ing aggravated wounds at the normal rate (see p. 285).",V20 Corebook,172
Necromancy,Path of the Four Humors,1,Whisper's to the Soul,"The necromancer with this ability can let slip a little 
of her own undead bilious humor as she speaks to an
other being (whether mortal or Kindred). The wicked 
vapor slips into the target’s ear and whispers night
mares to the target throughout the day and night. The 
target has a harder time sleeping, and becomes irritable 
and distracted during his waking hours.","The character must whisper the target’s 
name (as she knows it) into his ear. The victim rolls 
Willpower (difficulty 8). If the roll fails, the victim suf
fers from nightmares and hears mad, wicked mutter
ings while awake, for a number of full days equal to the 
necromancer’s Manipulation. The victim loses one die 
from all dice pools while thus afflicted, and at the Sto
ryteller’s discretion, the difficulty to resist Rötschreck 
may be increased by one at the same time.",V20 Corebook,173
Necromancy,Path of the Four Humors,2,Kiss of the Dark Mother,"Kiss of the Dark Mother allows the necromancer 
who uses it to mix her vitae with black bile, turning it 
into a noxious poison. The necromancer forces it into 
her mouth as saliva might once have come; the vitae 
tastes acrid and bitter, as though it had been scorched. 
Once the necromancer coats her teeth and lips with it, 
she can inflict terrible damage with her bite.","The player spends one blood point; activat
ing this power is a reflexive action, but it must be done 
before making a bite attack. If the bite hits, the aggra
vated damage inflicted by a single bite is doubled before soak is calculated. This power does not affect the 
character’s ability to drain blood from the target, nor 
does it increase the amount of damage done by blood 
loss. The necromancer’s bite remains potent until this 
ability is discharged by a successful hit or she spends 
one turn cleansing the dark blood from her mouth.",V20 Corebook,173
Necromancy,Path of the Four Humors,3,Dark Humors,"The vampire can exude a coat of a particular humor 
onto her skin, causing all that touch it to experience 
the most intense form of that humor. After a necro
mancer has used this power, she generally feels the 
opposite of the sensation the humor usually conveys: 
Using blood leaves her depressed and pessimistic; using 
yellow bile renders her calm and placid; using black 
bile leaves her optimistic; and using phlegm makes her 
aroused and angry.","The player spends two blood points. The 
necromancer chooses which humor she wishes to ex
crete. The humor can simply coat the skin — in which 
case touching the victim’s skin lets the humor take ef
fect — or it can act as a poison if placed in a bever
age (or in vitae). The victim must make a Stamina roll 
(difficulty 8) to resist the effects of the humor:
 • Phlegm: Target becomes lethargic; all dice pools 
are reduced by two for the remainder of the scene.
 • Blood (vitae): Target becomes prone to excessive 
bleeding, and any lethal or aggravated wounds he suf
fers deal an additional health level of damage on the 
turn after they originally occur. Vitae altered by Dark 
Humors will not turn a human into a ghoul if ingested, 
nor will it initiate a blood bond.
 • Black Bile: Target suffers a number of health levels 
of damage equal to the necromancer’s Stamina. This 
damage is considered lethal and can be soaked (if the 
victim is normally capable of soaking such damage), 
though armor does not protect against it.
 • Yellow Bile: Target becomes melancholic and is 
plagued with visions of death. He cannot spend Will
power for the remainder of the scene, and all Willpow
er rolls receive a +2 difficulty.",V20 Corebook,173
Necromancy,Path of the Four Humors,4,Clutching the Shroud,"Blood, the sanguine humor, was regarded by philoso
phers as being both hot and wet. Blood from a cold 
corpse has been transubstantiated into a dead form — 
a cold incarnation of a hot, wet element. This trans
formation of the living into death holds great power; 
the necromancer knows how to infuse her own being 
with the blood of a cold corpse and transform herself 
into something not wholly vampiric. Instead, the nec
romancer edges closer to being an animated corpse in 
fact as well as name. She grows distant and chill, as 
though possessed by the spirit of Death itself; she has to 
work to push her attention into the physical world.","The character must drink, and then spend, 
five blood points from a cold corpse (one dead for 24 
hours or more, but generally less than three days). It 
will generally take at least two turns to consume that 
blood, and the power is not activated until the char
acter can spend all of it. For example, if the character 
is Twelfth Generation, Clutching the Shroud takes at 
least seven turns total to activate (two to consume the 
blood and five to spend it). 
After the power is active and for the rest of the scene, 
the necromancer gains several benefits. First, she re
ceives two additional soak dice, which may be used to 
soak any sort of damage, even if the character does not 
possess Fortitude. Second, she gains a mystic sense of 
how far those in the area are from death — whether 
they are healthy or infirm, suffer from diseases, or are 
undead, ghouls, or mortals. Finally, a Manipulation + 
Occult roll lets her speak with ghosts freely. The difficulty for this roll depends on how attuned to death a 
locale is; a cemetery would be difficulty 5, while a cozy 
apartment might be difficulty 7. However, this ability 
makes the necromancer much more susceptible to the 
effects of powers used by ghosts, which means that she 
must act carefully.",V20 Corebook,173-174
Necromancy,Path of the Four Humors,5,Black Breath,"A necromancer who has mastered this path can har
ness the undead black bile that festers at the core of her 
being; she pulls that melancholy to her lungs and lets it 
mingle with her outgoing breath. She then exhales the 
dark mist, letting it engulf those nearby. The necro
mancer feels curiously lightheaded and optimistic after 
using this power, as she has forced some of her most 
depressed nature out into the world; those caught in 
the black vapors grow despairing and hopeless.","The player spends one Willpower and one 
blood point, and rolls Stamina + Athletics (difficulty 
7). Black Breath allows the character to exhale a dark 
cloud of vapor that is five yards or meters in diameter per 
success rolled. Those caught in the mists may attempt 
a Dexterity + Athletics roll to escape it if they have an 
available action; otherwise, they may be overwhelmed 
by depression to the point of suicide. Those who can
not escape the mists must immediately roll Willpower (difficulty 8 for mortals, 7 for supernatural beings) and 
achieve more successes than the invoker did. Mortals 
who fail in this actively attempt to kill themselves on 
their next turn. They do not attempt such ludicrous 
suicides as praying for a lightning bolt or holding their 
breath; they use the most effective means at hand to 
end their own lives. If prevented from suicide, they at
tempt it again as soon as an opportunity presents itself. 
This impulse lasts for the rest of the scene, and the Sto
ryteller may impose flare-ups over the next day or so at 
his discretion. Those who succeed on the Willpower 
roll still become enchanted with the prospect of death, 
whether mortal or Kindred, and lose two dice from all 
dice pools for the rest of the scene.
 Kindred who fail the Willpower roll do not attempt 
suicide; as they are already dead, the malign influences 
of undead humors do not have as strong an effect on 
them. Instead, the affected vampire sinks into torpor. 
The duration of this torpor is based on the vampire’s 
Humanity or Path rating, just as if lethal wounds had 
forced him into it.",V20 Corebook,174
Necromancy,Vitreous Path,1,Eyes of the Dead,"The necromancer employing the Eyes of the Dead 
can see with the perceptions of the Restless Dead 
(called Deathsight). To such a manipulator of ghostly 
energies, the auras of surrounding beings give off tell
tale hints as to their health and even their ultimate 
fate; the necromancer can see the energies of death flowing through everyone, just as ghosts can. By look
ing at the entropic markings on a person’s body, the 
necromancer can gain rough knowledge of how far that 
person is from death, how soon that person is likely to 
die, and even what the cause of her death is likely to be. The information thus gained is not exact by any 
means, but it gives the necromancer an edge over those 
she scrutinizes.","The player rolls Perception + Occult, difficulty 6. One success lets a necromancer determine whether someone is injured, diseased, or dying, as well as whether the individual labors under any sort of curse or baleful magic. 
Further, the vampire can divine the target’s eventual 
demise, depending on the successes scored. One suc
cess means the character can guess how long the tar
get has to live to within a few weeks. Three successes 
means the character can estimate how long the target 
has to live and what the probable source of death will 
be, as the entropic markings show the wounds that will 
someday exist on that person. Five successes means the character can actually see where and when the event will occur by interpreting the black marks on the target’s soul. 
This ability lasts for one scene, though the necro
mancer may choose to end the power early. It can be 
used to read the fate of only one target at a time. Story
tellers should exercise judgment with this power, since 
the markings of death are typically unavoidable. He 
may decide to roll the dice himself, so that the player 
has no way of knowing whether her insight is correct.",V20 Corebook,174
Necromancy,Vitreous Path,2,Aura of Decay,"The necromancer can strengthen the feeling of en
tropy around her to the point where it breaks down 
nonliving objects and machines. It can gnarl wood, 
rust metal, crack silicon chips, and erode plastic, glass, 
and dead organic material. This power has a range of 
one yard or meter from the necromancer’s body, but all 
those in the presence of the vampire can feel her cor
ruption as an icy wind.","No roll is required, but this power does cost 
at least one blood point. Objects subjected to this Aura 
of Decay break down and become useless after being 
targeted. How the object gives out, as well as the exact 
mechanism of failure, is up to the Storyteller. Corro
sion, metal fatigue, or sheer brittleness are all suitably 
likely for any given item’s demise, but the in-game ef
fect of using a doomed item is as if the owning charac
ter rolled a botch. The speed at which an item breaks 
down depends on how many blood points are spent.
 
 Blood Spent Time to Breakdown
 One       One week
 Two       One day
Three       End of scene
Four       Five turns  
Five       One turn

 Note that since this power requires the expenditure 
of blood points, a character cannot cause an Aura of 
Decay while staked. ",V20 Corebook,175
Necromancy,Vitreous Path,3,Soul Feast,"Just as the necromancer can release entropic ener
gies from within, she may also pull them into herself 
as a source of power. Soul Feasting allows the caster 
to either draw on the ambient death energies around 
her or to actively feed on a ghost, stealing the wraith’s 
substance and mystically transforming that energy into 
sustenance.","The player spends one Willpower point to allow the vampire to feed on the negative energies of the dead. If the character is drawing the energies from the atmosphere, she must be in a place where death has occurred within the hour or in a place where death is common, such as a cemetery, a morgue, or the scene of a recent murder. Generally, the necromancer can draw anywhere from one to four points of entropy from such a location, although the difficulty in using all Necromancy and similar deathly powers within the area increases by an equal amount for a number of nights 
equal to the points taken. The energies of such an area 
may only be drained once until the area’s entropy re
plenishes.
In cases when the necromancer feeds on a ghost, the 
vampire must actually attack the wraith as if feeding 
normally. Wraiths have up to 10 “blood points” that 
may be taken from them, and they become less and 
less substantial as their spirit essence drains away. The 
character is vulnerable to any attack the ghost might 
make, even those that do not normally affect the phys
ical world; while feeding, the vampire is essentially in 
a half-state, existing in both the living lands and the 
Underworld simultaneously. The wraith so attacked is 
considered immobilized and cannot run or escape un
less it can defeat the vampire in a resisted Willpower 
roll (difficulty 6 for both sides). This power may also 
be used in conjunction with Ash Path Necromancy, 
allowing the vampire to drain power (though not sus
tenance) from ghosts while traveling in the lands of 
the dead.
 This soul energy may be used just like blood in every respect except for when the vampire rises for the 
night. It can activate Disciplines, heal wounds, boost 
Attributes, etc. Botching this power renders the vam
pire unable to feed through the Shroud for the rest of 
the night. However, she remains susceptible to the as
saults of ghosts and spirits for several turns (generally, 
a number of turns equal to the amount of energy that 
could have been drawn from the area, or one turn if at
tacking a ghost) as she hovers between worlds, unable 
to function effectively in either.",V20 Corebook,175-176
Necromancy,Vitreous Path,4,Breath of Thanatos,"The Breath of Thanatos allows the necromancer to 
draw out entropic energy and focus it upon an area 
or person by taking a deep breath and then forcefully 
exhaling a fog of necromantic energy. This cloud of 
virulence is completely invisible to anyone without the 
ability to see the passing of entropy. The energy of this 
cloud is like a beacon for Spectres, and they are drawn 
to the entropic force like moths to a flame.
 Once the energy is pulled from the necromancer’s 
body, she can either disperse it over a large area as a 
lure for Spectres, or use the mist for more sinister pur
poses. Channeled into an object or person, the death
mist inflicts the subject with a debilitating, wasting ill
ness. Furthermore, the focused energies are tainted and 
eerie, and though generally invisible (except to powers 
such as Aura Perception), they tend to cause people 
and animals to feel uncomfortable around the victim.","The player spends one blood point and rolls 
Willpower (difficulty 8). Only one success is needed to 
draw out the Breath of Thanatos. If dispersed to sum
mon Spectres, the energies cover roughly one-quarter 
of a mile (400 meters) in radius, centered around the 
necromancer. The range increases by an additional 
one-quarter mile or 400 meters for every additional 
blood point expended. 
Spectres summoned with this power will ignore the 
summoning necromancer for the duration of the pow
er unless provoked, but may well go out of their way 
to wreak havoc on anyone else in the vicinity. The 
necromancer can then use other Necromancy powers 
(such as those in the Sepulchre Path) to manipulate 
and affect these Spectres. Ghosts so targeted may then 
interact with the necromancer as normal, although the 
other Spectres in the area will continue to ignore both 
the vampire and the targeted ghost. This energy dis
perses after a scene, after which the Spectres leave to 
find new prey. Mechanics for Spectres can be found on 
p. 385.
If the cloud is directed toward a particular target, the 
necromancer must either touch the target or direct the 
stream of entropy using Dexterity + Occult (difficulty 
7). A target laden with entropy suffers one (and only 
one) level of aggravated damage; this generally mani
fests as sudden illness or decay. The target’s social difficulties while interacting with those unfamiliar with 
the touch of death — most normal humans, as well as 
some supernatural creatures — increase by 2. Further
more, supernatural perceptions indicate the target is 
tainted with decay, which can be dangerous. This form 
of taint lasts until sunrise; a victim already plagued by 
this power cannot be affected again until the previous 
fog of entropy has dispersed.
 A botch on the roll to control this power indicates 
that the vampire has turned the energy upon himself, 
and suffers all the effects of the vitriolic breath. This 
inflicts the usual injury and may subject the necroman
cer to the possibly dangerous attention of provoked 
Spectres and other creatures from beyond the grave.",V20 Corebook,176
Necromancy,Vitreous Path,5,Night Cry,"The breath of entropic energy becomes a scream of 
pure chaos. The necromancer can issue an unearthly cry 
(heard both in the living world and in the Shadowlands). 
The howl pours icy oblivion into a target or group of 
targets — either sweeping away the inherent entropy or 
collecting that destruction and unleashing it. ","The vampire chooses a number of targets 
within one yard or meter per dot of Necromancy and 
invokes Night Cry with a terrible scream. The player 
spends a Willpower point and a blood point for each 
target beyond the first. (In other words, she spends 
no blood if only going after one target, or one blood 
for two targets. Generational blood limits apply, and 
the vampire may not “pre-spend” blood prior to using 
Night Cry.) 
The player then chooses whether the vampire will aid 
or harm the targets, and rolls Manipulation + Occult 
(difficulty 6). If she chooses to aid the target or targets, 
each success gives each affected target a -2 difficulty 
modifier to all of his actions for one turn per success. If 
she instead chooses harm, each success causes an aggra
vated wound to each target. Targets may be any kind of 
living creature, including supernatural ones.
 No matter the result, the Night Cry is heard on both 
sides of the Shroud, attracting the attention of anyone 
nearby. On a botch, the necromancy may summon un
ruly ghosts or Spectres, similar to Breath of Thanatos 
(although the ghosts are under no compulsion to ig
nore the necromancer…).",V20 Corebook,176-177

Necromancy,Path of Haunting,1,Song of the Dead,"The necromancer weaves death and silence into a 
haunting song that instills an obsession with death in 
her listener. The victim becomes sure that death stalks 
him and sees ill omens everywhere. The constant threat 
can eventually lead a mortal to suicide or drive a vampire 
into torpor.","The vampire chants to the victim while her 
player spends one blood point and rolls Manipulation 
+ Occult (difficulty of the target's current Willpower). A 
botch indicates the vampire affects herself as though she 
had gained successes equal to the number of 1s rolled.
For a number of nights equal to the successes rolled, the 
target suffers depression and morbid anxiety. This fixation 
adds +2 to the difficulty of Social rolls (except those involving 
Intimidation) and +1 to the difficulty of all other non-reflex-
ive rolls. If a target suffers the effects of this power for more 
continuous nights than his permanent Willpower, he loses 
a dot of permanent Willpower. This cycle continues after 
an interval of the new rating in days, with the victim losing 
a dot of permanent Willpower after each such iteration. 
Once a character drops to zero permanent Willpower, he 
commits suicide (If living) or falls into torpor (If a vampire). 
If the power is interrupted for at least one night, the victim 
recovers his permanent Willpower at the rate of one dot 
per week. A vampire who falls into otrpoer from reaching 
zero Willpower awakens with his original rating.",The Black Hand: A Guide to the Tal'Mahe'Ra,174-175
Necromancy,Path of Haunting,2,Summon Wisp,"Straddling two worlds, the necromancer does not truly 
exist. She is here, yet she is not. Reaching into herself, she 
infuses a spark of her own ephemeral nature with dark, 
necromantic energy. The result is a dancing light, which 
is as hypnotic as it is treacherous.","The player spends one blood point and rolls 
Charisma + Occult (difficulty 5) to conjure an orb of pale 
light that lasts one scene. The wisp can take any color the 
vampire chooses and has no substance or weight. It may 
fly as fast as the vampire can run, casting cold illumination 
as bright as a candle. Mortals who behold the wisp must 
roll Willpower (difficulty 4) and achieve more successes 
than the caster or fall into a mild trance, which adds +1 
to the difficulty of all actions due to distraction. If the 
vampire's successes are double the mortal's, he follow 
the light without regard for any but the most obvious 
obstacles. He walks around trees and rocks, but falls prey 
to quicksand or a high parapet. Any loud noise or other 
distraction immediately breaks the reverie.
If the vampire's player botches the conjuration roll, the 
wisp appears and acts with its own malevolent agenda.

Manipulation + Occult (difficulty of the target's permanent 
Willpower). If successful, the victim feels a slight sense of 
unease. When he next sleeps, he suffers horrible night- 
mares about his own demise. Even though he cannot fully 
remember the content of his visions after he wakes, the 
emotional trauma prevens him from regaining Willpower. 
In addition, his twisted deja vu and unnatural parranoia 
give him the Nightmares and Eerie Presence Flaws (V20, P. 
495) for the day. A botch in castting his power inflicts the 
same terrible dreams on the vampire when she slumbers.",The Black Hand: A Guide to the Tal'Mahe'Ra,175-176
Necromancy,Path of Haunting,4,Phantasms,"The necromancer recognizes the passion of the dead 
as an illusion. Drawing upon her insight, she may turn 
these illusions to haunt the living.","The vampire envisions the desired appari- 
tion, while the player spends one blood point and roll 
Manipulation + Occult (Difficulty 7). These creations have 
no substance and cannot speak or perform complicated 
actions, though hey emit a surreal cold. Each success 
allows the vampire to create one phenomenon, or add 
one characteristic or condition to another phantom. For 
example, three successes could animate shadows to shuffle 
and writhe (one success) and create an illusion of dripping 
gore that bursts into a spray of flies when someone draw 
close (one success for the gore and one success for the 
condition). This power may create apparitions anywhere 
in the caster's line of sight. The Storyteller remains the 
final arbiter of what is or is not possible with this power.

succesful, the victim feels a sudden chill. The difficulty 
for ghosts to affect the target with any power decreases by 
one for every success rolled, or a minimum of difficulty 
4. Malicious ghosts flock to the target, eagerly inflicting 
every horror at their disposal. The difficulty reduction 
diminishes by one every day at dawn until the victim 
returns to normal and the spectres lose interest. Multiple 
applications of this power may not be stacked to increase 
duration or intensity of effect. The statistics and powers

that were never alive, and may not be dragged into the
Tempest or any other place that has no corresponding
location in the living world. Tainted plant matter rots by
the next sunrise and loses the ability to impart this state. Witches’ fruits are mild hallucinogens. Twisted visions

rebirth and growth, and neopagans say Green Man iconography
remembers the god who is slain by Winter and
reborn in the Goddess’ womb. Nightshade necromancers
channel these legends into the act of raising a corpse bound
and strengthened by plant matter. Leaves cover its skin
and strong vines supplement its rotted sinews. The living
shell grants speed and self-preservation instincts not seen
in other animated dead.","The player rolls Wits + Occult (difficulty 8). He
spends one Willpower point and one blood point while
concentrating on a corpse that lays upon or within fertile
soil. If the roll succeeds, red-tinged vines, branches, and

bidding. The necromancer may only raise the
Green Ones one at a time, and may never have multiple
Green Ones active at the same time.

soul, and after dispatching him, traps it within her. At a
later time, she may call it forth as a ghost to do her bidding.","The vampire must drink at least one point of
a mortal victim’s blood, but may kill him using another
method. Another person or incident may cause the mortal’s
demise, but the necromancer must make physical
contact with him at the moment of death. At that point
the player spends one point of Willpower and rolls Wits

occupies the vampire’s body in a dormant state for up to
one month per success. (Aura Perception or similar powers
will reveal the presence of the dormant soul, which might
be mistaken for a form of possession.) The necromancer
may store multiple souls this way, but “twins,” “triplets,”
and more tax the “mother’s” energy. Each soul stored
beyond the first drains one additional blood point when
the vampire awakens each night.

may summon it forth to manifest with either the traits
of a recently deceased ghost (see V20, p. 385) or those it
possessed in life, along with a recently deceased ghost’s
supernatural abilities. It must perform three services for
its “mother.” After that, the soul is free to move on to its
ultimate destiny. If the ghost is commanded to perform
any task that would traumatize a mortal (typically, those
which would risk a Humanity check in a vampire with
that trait at 7) it may, at the Storyteller’s discretion, treat
the necromancer as a “fetter,” an object that the ghost
fixates upon and uses as a tie to the living world. This gives
the ghost the ability to haunt the necromancer until it is
banished. The necromancer may always simply dismiss

This power may ensnare any victim who stands upon the earth within 100 feet/30 meters of the koldun."," Like Grasping Soil, every success on the ac-tivation roll leaves the victim immobile for one turn. However, the difficulty of the Strength + Survival roll to break free increases to 8 and doing so still requires five successes. As the earth continues to shift and grasp while the power remains active, this roll must be made as a single (though repeatable) attempt rather than an extended test. In addition, beings trapped in the crush-ing pit suffer one level of lethal damage each turn. Be-ings capable of soaking this damage may do so, but at difficulty 7.

Koldunic Sorcery,The Way of Earth,4,Root of Vitality,"As with Hungry Earth, the koldun may direct the land to bury any target standing on the earth within a 100-foot/30-meter radius. Yet this power is far more benevolent in its intent, if no less disturbing in its manifestation. The soil ripples, parting and closing like some obscene womb as it draws the target a full yard beneath the surface. Living beings entombed in this fashion do not suffocate, as the enchanted soil pumps air from above in undulating breaths. Better still, the fertile essence of the earth presses upon her flesh and restores it to new health. Still, the process is highly disturbing and unnatural, especially as targets remain wholly aware in silent, helpless immobility for the full duration. It is possible for a koldun to heal himself with this power."," The player spends as many blood points as desired (which may require multiple turns depending on Generation) and makes the activation roll. Each success permits the earth to heal two levels of bash-ing damage or one level of lethal damage. Healing ag-gravated damage requires two successes per level. The total number of health levels that may be restored with each use of this power is the number of blood points invested or the number of successes on the activation roll, whichever is lower. Any blood points spent be-yond the number of successes drain away to no effect. The actual healing process takes one turn per bashing level, one minute per lethal level, and one hour per aggravated level.

molten rock without a Courage roll (difficulty 8), and

aggravated damage. Actual contact with the lava increases
the damage to three levels and raises the soak

wave enveloping the victim. Individuals slain with
this gruesome power appear as withered, mummified

crashing to earth and flowing in all directions. Anything
in the path of the molten rock burns, melts, or
vaporizes within moments. The caster may direct the
lava to erupt anywhere in his line of sight.","This power costs one Willpower point in addition
to a blood point. For every success on the activation
roll, the initial lava burst lasts one turn. The rivers
of burning liquid rock then flow sluggishly for twice
this duration before suddenly cooling and hardening.
Even if an object survives the heat, it now lies trapped
beneath the rock. Anything that makes contact with
lava (including the koldun) suffers a minimum of three
levels of aggravated damage. For objects that don’t
have health levels, the Storyteller must decide how

cunning seduction.","With a successful activation roll, the koldun
may project an illusion on any water surface in line
of sight. The illusion may speak and move however the
vampire wishes, though it has no substance and cannot
step beyond the bounds of the water. The phantom
lasts one turn per success rolled, after which it slowly
dissipates into fine mist. It is possible to extend this
lifespan with subsequent activations of the power, each
of which stack in determining final duration. Rolls to
extend an illusion’s duration add one to the base difficulty,

are solid enough to grab a man and drag him to a watery
grave or pummel him like the crashing surf.","The player spends one Willpower point and
makes the standard activation roll. With success, the
player may spend blood to summon elemental minions.
This blood must be dripped or flung into a body of water,
which may require multiple turns depending on
generational limits for blood expenditure.
Once the last drop of blood falls, the water rises into
whatever form the koldun desires. The caster may create
as many minions as blood points spent, though not
more than the total number of successes rolled. Regardless
of their form, the spirits have a rating equal to
the vampire’s Wits in all Traits. These beings have no
Knowledges and no Skills apart from Stealth. Further more, their Mental and Social Attributes are considered
to have a rating of 1 except in passive or defensive situations
(such as to resist persuasion or mind-control).
Water elementals soak and otherwise suffer damage as
vampires, including from sunlight. Fire harms them less,
inflicting bashing damage only. Moreover, the watery
creatures may extinguish flames with their liquid bodies,
though not without suffering injury. An elemental
who leaves the body of water that spawned it suffers
one level of aggravated damage per hour. Minions regenerate
one level of damage of any kind (including
aggravated) each turn they remain in contact with a

Shroud of Oblivion centers on and follows the koldun.
The power has a radius of five feet/two meters per success
scored on the activation roll, and a duration (in turns)
equal to the successes. All those within the radius benefit
from the shroud’s effects. The effects of this power differ
according to what land the koldun is currently located
(see the sidebar “Vampires in the Underworld” on p. 119):
while in the mortal world, damage from sunlight lessens
to bashing. If anywhere in the Underworld, the faint sun
deals no damage.
When the duration of the power expires, the koldun
bleeds out, losing one point of blood each turn until
he expends a blood point to rejuvenate his skin (unless
in the Underworld, in which case no blood is lost).

the duration ends. Healing prior to that time suspends
the power’s effects.",The Black Hand: A Guide to the Tal'Mahe'Ra,170

those in the vicinity with a glimpse of the world
beyond that of the living. Spectral Cloak conceals the
koldun from unfriendly eyes and drives away unwanted
observers in terror.","The koldun plucks out her eyes, crushes them
in her hands, and extends her palms to the sky, then
makes the activation roll (Attribute: Perception). With
a success, the pulp turns to dust and takes flight on an
eerie howl of wind that pours from a fathomless darkness
within her empty sockets. Shadows drawn from the surroundings
engulf the koldun who vanishes, rendering her
invisible to standard vision (for those with Auspex, see
the sidebar “Seeing the Unseen” on p. 142 of V20, using
the koldun’s rating in this kraina). Though the koldun
sees normally inside the radius of the power’s effect, she
is blind to anything outside of this area. Others within
the radius must succeed on a Willpower roll (difficulty
equal to the koldun’s rating in the kraina plus successes
scored on the activation roll, maximum 9), or be afflicted
with the Deathsight Flaw (V20, p. 494) and attempt to
flee in fright for a number of turns equal to the successes
scored on the activation roll.

allowing her to move about and act on others, even
violently, without being revealed. Spectral Cloak has a
radius of ten feet/three meters per success scored on
the activation roll and a duration (in turns) equal to the
successes. When the duration of the power expires, the
koldun is abandoned to blindness until she expends one
blood point to heal (unless in the Underworld, where the
koldun may continue to see indefinitely, despite the loss
of her eyes). Penalties sustained to activate this power are

through the earth past any obstruction blocking their path,
then cross over the threshold which separates the vibrant
lands of the living from the desiccated lands of the dead.

seething, writhing spectres. Ghostly arms stretch out
to clutch and feast upon those walking through the

koldun, who remains locked in place from the waist
down until the power ends.

roll, maximum 9) or lose 1 point of permanent Willpower.
When the duration of the power expires, the koldun
severs his viscera buried in the earth and incurs two
levels of unsoakable lethal damage. This damage cannot
be healed by any other means other than by spending
blood. Additionally, the koldun loses an amount of
blood points equal to half the successes scored on the
activation roll, rounded up (unless in the Underworld,
in which case no blood is lost). Wounds sustained to

her mouth and a choir of voices not her own issue a
deafening cry that blends into thunder as storm clouds
gather above her for the remainder of the turn. A
still silence follows as the koldun stands frozen, her
expression transfixed, echoing the call. Moments later,
a roaring hurricane explodes around her, breaching
forth from the land of the dead with all the fury of
the Underworld. Its eye, a focused funnel, descends
into the koldun’s mouth, causing her to convulse and
writhe as she rises thirty feet into the air.
The tempest has a radius of twenty feet/seven meters

Koldunic Sorcery,Kraina of Enoch,5,Hunger of the Void,"The koldun embodies the distortions of the Tempest,
torturing his soul to cleave a pit of perfect destruction
into reality.","The koldun spends a Willpower point, reaches
down his throat, and pulls out his own soul. He spends
a turn tormenting and stretching the spirit’s mouth ever
wider as it mutely protests, clawing impotently at its violator
in shocked disbelief. He tosses the contorted soul to the
earth at his feet, then makes the activation roll (Attribute:
Strength) before diving into it. With a success, the giant
maw transforms into a cavity five feet in circumference that
begins sucking in all it can to appease its insatiable appetite.
The power has a radius of twenty five feet/eight meters
per success scored on the activation roll and a duration
(in turns) equal to the successes. All those within the
radius are dragged ten feet/three meters per turn toward
the Nihil, and have their speed slowed by half every five
feet/two meters nearer they are to it. If consumed by the
maw, they disappear and must make a Willpower roll
(difficulty 9). After the power ends, the Nihil implodes,
leaving an enormous crater in its wake. At the base of
the crater lies the koldun with all the maw has consumed
resting on top of him. Characters who have failed the
roll are turned into mindless creatures, their virtues and
morality stripped from them completely and reduced to
zero. Vampires succeeding on the roll enter a Harrowing
(see Wrath of the Tempest) for the rest of the scene and
gain a derangement. Regardless of success or failure, any
mortal consumed by the pit has its soul obliterated and
enters a permanent coma.
A vampire’s undead stasis cannot incarnate this otherworldly
energy. Upon the power’s conclusion, fissures

know it. Demons, much like dogs, always endeavor to
come when called by their masters. The technique of
conjuring forth Hell’s dwellers has ever been a staple at
the table of infernal practice.","Necessitating a full scene of uninterrupted focus
and the expenditure of one blood point to enact, the
koldun performs a long series of incantations while tracing
glyphs surrounding a circle in his own blood around the
entrance to his Well of Sacrifice. The power and strength
of a demon the koldun is capable of summoning rises proportionate
to the level of his advancement in the kraina.
As the koldun’s skill in the kraina rises, so, too, does his
ability to invoke demons of increasing power. Over the

of them, and even then, there’s no guarantee they need
answer truthfully. The player may choose to summon the
same demon again at a later date if a bargain was struck but
unfulfilled before the conclusion of the power’s duration.

infernal company.","By sipping a blood point directly from her
Well, the koldun adds her levels attained in Kraina of

and a blood point to coat an amulet in her blood, then
makes the activation roll (Attribute: Charisma). For the
remainder of the scene, the koldun adds successes scored
on the activation roll to the difficulty rating for supernatural
attacks and influences of infernal origin used to
target her (such as infernally blessed objects, Investments
and Gifts, or any Disciplines and blood sorcery powers
wielded by infernalists and demons). She also gains an
amount of extra dice on rolls to resist those same effects
equal to the amount of successes scored. Any mundane or
mystical object may be consecrated as an amulet; popular
choices include ceremonial daggers, shamed crucifixes,
or decapitated heads that animate to scream endlessly
in silence. However, only the koldun benefits from the
protection granted through Aegis Alighieri and must have
the amulet on her person for this power to function. Prior
to activating this power, the koldun is required to have
dipped the amulet in her Well, letting it soak therein for
one full night. Two or more koldun working together
in close proximity (within 50 feet/15 meters) grant each
other one extra success on resistance rolls and increase

foot/30 cm in diameter) into the earth and christening
it with one blood point. He chants a litany of admonishments

Koldunic Sorcery,Kraina of the Well,5,Reap the Well,"Kolduns who attain full mastery in Kraina of the Well
earn the sobriquet of “Hellreaper” by their peers, and
for good reason.","Upon summoning a demon or discovering an
escapee unfettered and loose outside the prison of Hell,
the koldun may attempt to bind and enslave the creature
to her will. The koldun cuts her wrists, taking a turn to
pool one blood point in her cupped hands in order to
fabricate a connection to her Well. When ready, she spends
a Willpower point and makes the activation roll (Attribute:
Strength). The blood leaps from her hands in the form
of six interlocking hooked chains anchored beneath her
slit wrists which lunge toward the target with unerring
precision (maximum 100 feet/30 meters). If the roll is a
success, the blood-hooks painfully latch into the entity,
creating gory wounds (no damage) regardless of whether the
creature possesses a physical form. An ensnared creature
may struggle to break one chain per turn by spending a
Willpower point, then rolling Willpower (difficulty equal
to the koldun’s permanent Willpower rating).
For as long as the hooks penetrate the entity’s body,
once per turn the koldun may demand its True Name, tormenting
the demon by rolling Intelligence + Intimidation
against the target’s current Willpower points to wrack its
soul with excruciating pain. With a success, the victim
cries out the answer in supplication. The koldun has
two choices: she may unshackle and dismiss the demon
through Heave the Host of Hell, or absorb it into herself.
A koldun that has acquired a demon’s True Name
reduces the difficulty level by two when evoking it at a
later date through Call the Children. Demons bound by
their True Name may exit the confines of a circle they’ve
been invoked within, and can be commanded by a koldun
to complete a number of tasks for a number of days
equal to the successes scored on the in vocation roll. The
demon will answer any of the koldun’s questions, and the
koldun does not need to offer an exchange of services for
questions or tasks.
If choosing to absorb a chained demon, the koldun
may spend a blood point to instantly call it forth again.
Chained demons are wholly compliant and serve the will
of the koldun in whatever capacity she demands, but must
remain in bondage (maximum 100 feet/30 meters) to the
koldun. A koldun can control up to six chained demonic
thralls; each chain divided decreases the amount of chains
available for future binding and increases the difficulty to
torment untamed demons by one.
A demon who disobeys or lies to a summoner who
knows its True Name when conjuring it causes a demon
crippling agony. Should Reap the Well be used to perform
a violent exorcism on a living host possessed by a demon,
the host rolls Stamina against a difficulty equal to the
amount of turns taken to tame the demon into revealing
its True Name. A failure results in the host dying of shock.
Multiple koldun may Reap the Well together, collectively
decreasing the difficulty to torment a demon by one per
chain (minimum 4). The Hellreaper who successfully extracts
the demon’s True Name on their turn may choose
to bind it or dismiss it. All koldun present hear the demon
howl its True Name, and if dismissed, may individually
conjure it. A demon in thrall to a Hellreaper cannot be
evoked until released from service.",The Black Hand: A Guide to the Tal'Mahe'Ra,174
Koldunic Sorcery,Transylvanian Kraina,1,Burebista's Throne,"Legend has it that King Burebista, who terrorized the
Greeks for centuries — first as the mortal king of Dacia,
and later as a mighty koldun — built a great throne atop
a mountain peak from which he could survey all his lands
and track the movements of all his enemies. The legend
is true, though in time Burebista no longer needed the
throne to observe his kingdom. He passed on this secret
to his childer, and today most every koldun of the Transylvanian
kraina can sit upon his throne.","The koldun spends a blood point and makes
the activation roll (Attribute: Perception). If atop any
mountain in Carpathia, there is no need to expend blood.
On a success, the koldun can send his senses soaring high
into the air, or extend them beyond their body; how far
depends on how many successes are rolled (see below).
This effect lasts until the koldun pulls back his senses or
the end of the scene, whichever comes first.
Successes Area

peak in the Carpathians, where the biting winds and
frigid temperatures will kill an unprotected man in mere
moments. A perfect setting to destroy one’s enemies.
Getting an unprepared foe up Pietrosu is quite difficult,
however; much easier, the kolduns reason, to take the
mountain with them.","The koldun must toss the requisite blood into
the air (unless they are standing within sight of the Carpathians,
in which case no blood expenditure is required)
and make the activation roll (Attribute: Dexterity). If they
succeed, a powerful, frigid wind arises all around the koldun
for a number of turns equal to successes rolled. This wind
causes one level of bashing damage each turn and numbs
the bodies of anyone except the koldun caught within,
reducing their movement by half and Dexterity pools by
two. On the turn after this power expires, the Dexterity
penalty is reduced to one and movement is three-quarters,
and the turn after that the victim regains full Dexterity
and mobility. A useful side effect of this power is that the
koldun is immune to the cold and force of wind while this
is active; when trekking in mountains or other environs
where wind may be a hazard, they need only activate
Pietrosu’s Hospitality to ward themselves from danger.",Vampire the Dark Ages - Core Rulebook,275

water - a river or stream is most common, though a rivulet
or even just runoff from thawing snow is enough — and
rolls to activate this power (Attribute: Strength). On a

and surge forward, a flash flood given magical life. Anyone,

instance — takes twice the normal amount of damage.
Additionally, mortals must make a swimming roll (difficulty
8) each turn to avoid swallowing great mouthfuls of water;
failure inflicts one additional level of lethal damage which
cannot be soaked. These rushing waters last for a number

of Ratesti, vegetation ceases to grow and the strange
gasses of the underworld bubble up into our world, forming
tiny cones of mud that quickly harden while they exhale
their frigid breaths. Some koldun have learned to summon
these deadly gasses for themselves; they claim it’s the breath
of Kupala himself. They may be right.","The koldun expends blood, at least one point’s
worth but as much as she wants, and rolls to activate this power

equal to the successes she rolled, to a limit of however much
blood was spent, she may cause the gasses beneath the ground
to erupt upward, forming a tiny volcanic crater. These gasses
are bitingly cold; anyone caught within a ten-foot radius of the
cone is subject to the same damage and penalties as Pietrosu’s
Hospitality. Even worse, the bubbling gas is highly flammable; any
nearby flame will ignite the gas in a terrible explosion, inflicting
five dice of lethal damage (aggravated to vampires) to all those
within range of the cone. If this power is activated within the

moorings and sometimes even killing the unwary. The
locals blame the gods, but the koldun know it is Kupala,
restlessly stirring within his earthen tomb. Those with the
greatest skill know how to rouse his agitations.","The koldun spends a Willpower point in
addition to the usual blood point and activation roll (Attribute:
Strength). If used within sight of the Carpathians,
no blood point expenditure is necessary. Each success allows
the koldun to either affect a larger area (see below) or
prolong the earthquake’s duration. Anyone and anything

lethal damage each turn they remain in its area of effect,

dozen nations en route to emptying into the Black Sea, the
mighty Danube has been the sustaining artery of countless
empires for as long as people have dwelt upon its banks. And
through all of them, the Tzimisce kept watch. The koldun
know its true value, for the spirits of the river speak to them,
passing on what they know or carrying messages for them in
exchange for a taste of the vampiric sorcerers’ vitae.","The koldun drips the requisite blood into a
river, stream, or other flowing waterway. Even the runoff
from thawing snow or a heavy rain is enough to make use
of this power. If it is the Danube itself, or one of its tributaries,
no initial expenditure of blood is necessary at all.
They then make the activation roll (Attribute: Charisma);
if they succeed, a spirit of the water appears to them and
will serve them (such as they can) for a number of days
equal to successes rolled. This duration may be extended
any time before it expires by splashing the water with more
blood; one blood point extends the spirit’s thralldom by an
additional day.
What the spirit can do is quite limited; they can converse
with the koldun, sharing whatever they know, or
they can give it a message to carry to someone or someplace
else. The spirit will be more than happy to talk of what it
knows; river spirits can be quite garrulous and the Tzimisce
is advised to help lead the spirit to the topics they’re most
interested in lest they be regaled for hours with prosaic
descriptions of surrounding countryside. The spirit is only
capable of moving up and down their waterway (and upstream
is much slower than down), so the recipient of the
message must be someone it can encounter in its journey.
Another method involves instructing the spirit to go to a
place along its path and delivering the message to the first
person it meets, though this obviously has its drawbacks as
well. A koldun may also beseech a water spirit to remain in
one place and watch for trespassers or other threats, then
to move quickly along the riverbed to warn her of danger
should any present itself.",Vampire the Dark Ages - Core Rulebook,277
Koldunic Sorcery,Black Sea Kraina,2,Grave of the Marea Neagra,"The Scythians of old had their own name for the great
sea around which they dwelt: axšaina, which translates
to “unlit” to our ears. Their description is apt; sunlight
fails to penetrate much beyond the surface and in the
deepest portions, even air ceases to exist. It is, in many
ways, the perfect sanctuary for a corpse, as attested to
by the many ships and their crews preserved for eternity
along its bottom, many of them put there by koldun who
dwell beneath the waves.","The koldun may always descend safely into
the lowest depths of the Black Sea, where she may rest
comfortably, protected from the sun and the outside world.

Koldunic Sorcery,Black Sea Kraina,4,Minions of Deep Marmora,"Legend says that the koldun Cyzicus, who ruled openly
as king of the Dollonians in days of antiquity, discovered
if he spilled his blood into the Sea of Marmora, strange
beasts from its depths would emerge to do his bidding.

GIFTS OF THE BLOOD
Other koldun have found that any body of water serves
the same, although the creatures that dwell in the deeps
of Marmora are the strongest."," The koldun splashes his blood upon the surface
of the water — at least one blood point, but as many as he
chooses to spend — then makes the activation roll (Attribute:
Manipulation). For each success, up to the total number of
blood points spent, one minion emerges from the water. The
Minions of Deep Marmora are strange humanoid creatures,
combining the features of frog and fish. They will perform one
task for the koldun, after which they are free to return to their
watery abodes. Each minion may be given a different task to
perform. Minions use the following stats (stats in parentheses
are for those minions summoned from the Black Sea itself):
Attributes: Strength 4 (5), Dexterity 3, Stamina 4 (5),
Charisma 1, Manipulation 1, Appearance 0, Perception
3, Intelligence 1 (2), Wits 2 (3)

water equally well. They’re accomplished swimmers,
moving as easily in water as out.",Vampire the Dark Ages - Core Rulebook,277-278
Koldunic Sorcery,Black Sea Kraina,5,Pontos Axeinos,"Before the Greeks settled its southern shoreline, they
called the Black Sea Pontos Axeinos, the Inhospitable Sea.
For the enemies of the koldun, it can be very inhospitable,
birthing storms, whirlpools, fog, and rocky barricades
where there were none moments before.","The koldun drips his blood into a body of
water (unless it is the Black Sea, in which case no blood
need be expended) and makes the activation roll (Attribute:
Intelligence). She may allocate their successes to manifest
any number of dangerous waterborne hazards for her opponents
to deal with; some examples of what each success
can accomplish: a whirlpool or undertow with a Strength
rating equal to the koldun’s Strength that may seize or drag
others, increase the current’s Strength multiplier by one,
reveal jagged rocks that do Strength + 3 lethal damage when
smashed upon, fog that increases all sight-based Perception
difficulties by 2, driving winds and rain with gales up to 50
miles per hour/75 km per hour, a precipitous drop in water
temperature to near freezing levels, and so on. This power

Koldunic Sorcery,Bialowieza Kraina,1,Domain Breach,"The koldun is so in tune with his domain that he is able
to detect when an intruder makes her way within its borders.
This Discipline isn’t so focused as to identify and spotlight
the location of the intruder, instead providing adequate
forewarning in advance of a surprise. A common tactic
upon sensing a visitor is to follow up by sending animal spies.","The koldun expends at least one point of blood
within the area he wishes to affect with this Discipline, and
the player rolls to activate this power (Attribute: Perception).
One square kilometer (2/3 of a mile) surrounding the koldun
is affected for each blood point spent. For the remainder of
the night, the koldun senses if any visitors enter or exit the
determined area.
If this power is activated within the Białowieza Forest, no
initial expenditure of blood is required. This power cannot
be used in a predominantly urban environment.",Vampire The Dark Ages - Tome of Secrets,46
Koldunic Sorcery,Bialowieza Kraina,2,Fingers of Bialowieza,"The koldun with this power commands nearby plants and
trees to ensnare, and potentially immobilize, their victims.
This Discipline affects plants of all size, compelling thin
roots through to old, twisted branches. Koldun often use
Fingers of Białowieza on plants surrounding paths leading
to their havens.","The koldun expends blood, ensuring it touches
the plant she wishes to affect, and rolls to activate this power
(Attribute: Dexterity). The plant will attempt to ensnare
anyone passing within two meters (2 yards) of its reach,
remaining ready to grapple in this way for one night per
blood point spent. For the purposes of grappling, the plant
rolls six dice. It inflicts one level of bashing damage for each
turn subsequent to a successful grapple. The plant gains an
additional die to grappling with each subsequent turn, to a
maximum of ten dice. Small plants possess two health levels

for the purposes of destruction, with tree limbs holding up
to six, depending on size. They hold one dot of Stamina for
each health level, and can soak bashing damage.

from their initial numbers, with Stamina increasing as a
byproduct of the increase in health.",Vampire The Dark Ages - Tome of Secrets,46-47
Koldunic Sorcery,Bialowieza Kraina,3,Grondrska's Impasse,"The tale tells of a poacher who trespassed into Tzimisce
lands. It wasn’t long before he was fleeing in a dread panic.
He thought he knew the forest, but the trees were moving
around him, cutting off his exit, herding him directly to the
hungry Cainite waiting within. Grondrska’s Impasse makes
this terrible legend a reality.","The koldun expends at least one point of blood
within the area she wishes to affect, and the player rolls to activate
this power (Attribute: Perception). One square kilometer
(2/3 of a mile) surrounding the koldun is affected for each blood
point spent. For the remainder of the night, any visitors sensed
using Domain Breach suffer an increased difficulty of three on
attempts to track, escape, and navigate within the area, as the
undergrowth shifts and looms around the intruder. If the visitor
fails his roll, the koldun can choose whether to move him closer,
farther away, or in the direction of a well-placed trap.
If this power is activated within the Białowieza Forest,
the undergrowth saps two dots from the visitor’s Perception,
returned if he leaves the area. The koldun can choose to
have this not affect certain visitors who triggered the power
of Domain Breach.",Vampire The Dark Ages - Tome of Secrets,47
Koldunic Sorcery,Bialowieza Kraina,4,The Mouth of Djabelek,"Djabelek is a terrifying Tzimisce buried somewhere within
the Białowieza Forest. It is said that somehow he continues
to feed despite his torpid state, opening his mouth while
dreaming, consuming whatever falls in. This power often
results in swift death for intruding mortals, as the earth opens
around them. Koldun are known to make use of The Mouth
of Djabelek near their havens as a security measure, and in
the heat of battle to catch an opponent unawares. A tongue
of cold mud drags the intruder down into the earth, with
grinding rocks and crushing earth pulverizing the victim.","The koldun spills at least one point of blood
within the earthen area she wishes to affect, and spends a
point of Willpower along with making the roll to activate this
power (Attribute: Strength). Should any being step within
ten meters (11 yards) of where the power was activated, a
pit two meters (2 yards) in diameter and three meters (3
yards) deep opens. Each blood point spent leaves the victim
trapped and immobile for a turn. To break free requires a
successful Strength-based roll on the part of the victim
(difficulty 8) and requires five successes on an extended test.
Beings trapped in the pit suffer two levels of lethal damage
each turn, which can be soaked (difficulty 7).
If this power is activated within the Białowieza Forest, the
duration of this power is doubled. The koldun can choose
to have this not affect certain visitors.",Vampire The Dark Ages - Tome of Secrets,47
Koldunic Sorcery,Bialowieza Kraina,5,The White Tower,"The Białowieza takes its name from Djabelek’s notorious
tower built of his victims’ bleached white bones, stacked
high to make a particularly foreboding haven. The tower
has long been absent from the forest, but occasional tales
of its reconstruction emerge from the wilderness — and not
always in the Białowieza Forest.
The White Tower is the gift provided by the demons of the
earth with whom Djabelek once made his pact. The bones
of all the victims of the Białowieza kraina force their way
from the earth and cocoon the koldun summoning them in
a tower of earth and bone at least five meters (5 1/2 yards)
tall. The koldun can remain inside the haven for as long as
her blood will hold out, or fold back into the earth with the
tower and reemerge elsewhere, away from danger.","The koldun scatters one point of blood on the soil;
the player spends a point of Willpower and makes the roll to
activate this power (Attribute: Stamina). The White Tower
takes effect immediately, the earth shifting, jagged bones and
blocks of earth forming an apparently organic circular wall
to surround the koldun, at five meters (5 1/2 yards) tall. For
each success on activation, another floor five meters high is
constructed above the initial one, one floor a turn. The White
Tower stretches beneath the earth as far as it stretches above
it, and bears no entrance or exit, unless the koldun wills one.
Any possessions left within the last time the Discipline was
activated remain in the tower. The White Tower is highly
resistant to external forces, possessing 20 levels of health and
an invulnerability to all but aggravated damage.
The White Tower can fold back into the earth with the
koldunic sorcerer in tow, at the expenditure of a further blood
point and single point of Willpower. At this point, the vampire
is effectively entombed five meters (5 1/2 yards) beneath the
earth at the location where the White Tower stood.
For the cost of an additional blood point and point of
Willpower, along with the roll for activating the power
(Attribute: Stamina), the White Tower emerges anywhere
within 20 kilometers (12 1/2 miles) of the previous location,
providing the area is forested. The size of this new White
Tower is established in the same manner as the initial roll.
The White Tower does not deconstruct if the koldunic
sorcerer wills an exit to appear and departs the building. If any Cainite falls to torpor inside the White Tower, or mortal
falls asleep within, it consumes them and adds the vampire’s
bones to the others lining the walls and floors.
If this power is activated within the Białowieza Forest, it
possesses double the levels of health.",Vampire The Dark Ages - Tome of Secrets,47-48

Dark Thaumaturgy,Path of Pain,1,The Numbing,"Broken bones, torture and ritualistic scarring are
all a source of delight for many on the Path of Pain.
Thaumaturges studying this path must fi rst learn how
to control and resist their instincts to avoid pain. Once
mastered, the Numbing allows the infernalist to explore
the limits of pain without becoming weakened
or incapacitated by it. However, overriding the Beast’s
instincts to avoid pain has caused many dark thaumaturges
to destroy themselves — literally reducing their
bodies to ashes."," For each success scored on the Willpower
roll, the thaumaturge can ignore the dice pool and movement
penalty for one health level of damage. This effect
lasts for a scene. The Numbing does not work with wound
penalties incurred from aggravated damage.",Sins of the Blood,86-87
Dark Thaumaturgy,Path of Pain,2,Anguish,"A thaumaturge on the Path of Pain can fl ood his
target with sensations of pain without having to actually
wound her. Although the injuries are not real, the pain
is. With a simple touch, the thaumaturge can send his
victim reeling in agony to the point of rendering her
unconscious or even comatose due to shock."," The practitioner needs to touch his target
in order to use this power (possibly requiring a Brawl roll,
at the Storyteller’s discretion). If the character does so,
the player can roll Willpower and spend a blood point
as normal. For every success, the target suffers the dice
pool penalty associated with losing the equivalent number
of health levels (starting with Hurt, not Bruised),
but he doesn’t suffer actual damage. When used against
mortals, nothing can be done to stop the pain. If the
target reaches Incapacitated, she falls unconscious.
Vampires and supernatural creatures can try to resist
by rolling Willpower. Each success on this roll cancels
one of the thaumaturge’s successes. A vampire may be
Incapacitated by this pain, but it will not force him into
torpor. Furthermore, a point of blood heals one level
of Anguish “damage.” The effects of Anguish last for a
scene otherwise.",Sins of the Blood,86-87
Dark Thaumaturgy,Path of Pain,3,Shattering,"At this level, the thaumaturge can break bones
and rupture organs, crippling his victim. The resulting
cacophony of compound fractures and bursting organs
are, more often than not, the last sounds the victim
ever hears."," The thaumaturge can use this power on
any one target within eyesight. To invoke Shattering,
he must sacrifi ce a health level in order to channel the
pain to the target. Once he does so, a point of blood
and a successful Willpower roll complete the process.
For each success, the thaumaturge infl icts a health level
of lethal damage that cannot be soaked. Vampires can
roll Willpower to resist the effects of the Shattering;
each success on the victim’s Willpower roll negates one
success of the thaumaturge. Additionally, creatures with
the ability to do so (Kindred, ghouls, etc.) may spend
blood points to heal the damage as normal.",Sins of the Blood,86-87
Dark Thaumaturgy,Path of Pain,4,Agony Within,"This terrifying power allows the thaumaturge to
create hooked tendrils out of his target’s own blood
that course through his veins and rip him to shreds. In
some extreme cases of this power’s use, the blood-barbs
actually burst the victim’s fl esh, ending his life in a gory
display."," In addition to the blood point expenditure
and Willpower roll, this power may require the thaumaturge
to wound himself to create the blood chains. For
each health level of bashing damage that the thaumaturge
infl icts on himself (minimum one), the player can add
one to the total number of successes from the Willpower
roll. This total is then applied as lethal damage to the
victim, as the blood tendrils bite into and rend the hapless
victim asunder from within. Mortals cannot soak Agony
Within damage, and vampires may use only Fortitude.
However, the target is allowed a Willpower roll with a
diffi culty equal to (6 + the number of health levels that
the thaumaturge infl icted upon himself [maximum 10]).
For every two successes on the Willpower roll (round
down), reduce the damage of Agony Within by one.",Sins of the Blood,86-87
Dark Thaumaturgy,Path of Pain,5,Hundred Deaths,"The ultimate expression of pain known to practitioners
of the Path of Pain, Hundred Deaths lacerates
the victim with countless deep cuts that constantly heal
and reopen. The pain drives the victim insane before
killing him outright."," Hundred Deaths requires the thaumaturge
to infl ict upon himself a single aggravated wound,
achieved by the player succeeding a Willpower roll
(diffi culty 6) fi rst. If successful, the player can then roll
Willpower and spend a blood point to evoke Hundred
Deaths. Each success infl icts one health level of aggravated
damage on the target, which can be soaked
only with Fortitude. The pain debilitates the target
completely, rendering her shocked by pain and unable
to do anything, including heal herself, without the expenditure
of a Willpower point. If the victim does not
receive medical attention or some form of supernatural
healing, she will suffer an additional health level of
lethal damage every night for each unhealed level of
aggravated damage that remains.",Sins of the Blood,86-87
Dark Thaumaturgy,Path of Pleasure,1,Ecstasy,"The thaumaturge can make the target feel intense
pleasure, tailoring the sensation from general sexual
arousal to mimicking the euphoria of the strongest drug
around. This power works regardless of the subject’s
tastes, simulating any kink or fetish, or stimulating simpler,
less complicated pleasures — whether the victim
consents or not."," Ecstasy requires the Willpower roll only
if the thaumaturge uses this power on an unwilling
target. Otherwise, physical contact and a blood point
are all that are needed. Once she is under the effects of
Ecstasy, the victim is fl ooded with physical sensations
so intense that she must score more success on a Wits +
Self-Control roll (diffi culty 7) than the thaumaturge’s
player’s Willpower roll to do anything except enjoy herself.
This power lasts as long as the thaumaturge continues to
touch the target. Once physical contact stops, the effect
wears down over the course of a number of turns equal
to (10 – the subject’s Willpower). During this time, the
victim exists in a mollifi ed, sluggish state and suffers a
+1 diffi culty to all actions.
Whatever sensation the thaumaturge used becomes
the focus of the Obsessive/Compulsive derangement if
the victim’s player fails her Self-Control roll.",Sins of the Blood,87-89
Dark Thaumaturgy,Path of Pleasure,2,Intrusion,"Intrusion functions much like Ecstasy, however, the
thaumaturge doesn’t need to touch the target. He can
communicate the pleasure through telepathic means."," Intrusion can be used on any individual
within eyesight of the thaumaturge. If successful, the
infernalist overwhelms the individual with a pleasurable
physical sensation of his (the infernalist’s) choice.
Because of the unexpected nature of the pleasure, the
victim suffers one bashing health level of damage for
each success scored on the Willpower roll. Note that
this bashing damage isn’t “painful” as such. It refl ects
the subject being immediately overwhelmed by pleasure.
Mortals cannot soak this damage, but vampires can resist
with a Willpower roll (diffi culty 7) of their own. Each
success negates one level of the bashing damage.
In all other respects, this power works like Ecstasy,
including Willpower and blood costs, as well as requiring
a Wits + Self-Control roll (diffi culty 7) to ignore the
pleasure long enough to take an action.",Sins of the Blood,87-89
Dark Thaumaturgy,Path of Pleasure,3,Daisy Chain,"This orgasmic power allows the thaumaturge to
spread pleasure to other people in a chain. Each person
that the infernalist touches becomes a vector for the
chosen pleasure, “infecting” anyone with whom he
comes in contact."," The Daisy Chain works exactly like Ecstasy,
however a Willpower roll is needed even if the target
consents to its use. For each success, the thaumaturge
can spread the sensation to another target (at the
rate of one per turn), who then experiences the same
sensation. Furthermore, each target can affect another
individual through touch (the new victim is allowed a
Self-Control roll to resist). Daisy Chain functions only if
the thaumaturge remains within eyesight of the victims,
or until a subject resists successfully, which also ends
that particular vector’s “contagion.”",Sins of the Blood,87-89
Dark Thaumaturgy,Path of Pleasure,4,Deadening,"This insidious power allows the thaumaturge to make
an individual numb to physical sensations and even
most emotions. While under the effect of Deadening,
the victim can feel nothing including pain or pleasure.
For all intents and purposes, he is dead to any and all
sensations. He exists as if in a daze, aware of being unable
to feel anything and incapable of doing anything
about it."," This power requires the standard blood
point and Willpower roll. The target is allowed to resist
by rolling Willpower (diffi culty equal to the thaumaturge’s
Manipulation + Empathy). If the thaumaturge
scores more successes, Deadening is successful. While
he is in this emotionally torpid state, the victim cannot
spend Willpower points, and any Virtue roll is at a +2
diffi culty. The number of successes scored determines
the duration of Deadening.

This power is exempt from the price: desires sated",Sins of the Blood,87-89
Dark Thaumaturgy,Path of Pleasure,5,The Garden of Earthly Delights,"With this power, the thaumaturge can totally
overwhelm a victim with pleasure until it renders her
catatonic, existing only in her mind and unaware of her
immediate surroundings or even her physical body."," To use this power, the victim must already
be under the effects of Ecstasy. Once this criteria is met,
the player makes another Willpower roll and spends an
additional blood point. If this second roll is successful, the
infernalist can fl ood the victim with pleasure until she
becomes comatose, her mind entering a dream-like state
where all she experiences are visions and sensations of
pleasure. To resist this power, the victim needs to score
more successes on a Willpower roll (diffi culty 8) than
the thaumaturge scored upon invocation. Remember,
though, that the target fi rst makes a Self-Control roll
as per the Ecstasy rules before this power even becomes
a possibility.
For each night a victim is under the effect of this
power, her body takes a level of bashing damage unless
the victim is being treated at a hospital. Vampires can
resist this damage with Stamina (and Fortitude). Successes
determine the duration of this power.

Dark Thaumaturgy,Path of the Defiler,1,Call the Weakness,"Defilers are adept social predators, able to surmise an
individual’s passions and weakness by engaging in idle
conversation. From a simple answer or a casual gesture,
the defi ler can piece together a complete mental picture
of the individual. The thaumaturge can use this information
to bring the victim under her sway."," Aside from the blood point and Willpower
roll needed to evoke Call the Weakness, the defi ler must
engage the victim in conversation. For each success, the
thaumaturge can ask the Storyteller a single question
about the target, which then must be answered truthfully.
Information that can be gleaned this way includes,
but is not limited to, Nature and Demeanor, Willpower
ratings, derangements, blood bonds and Virtues that the
character observes — in effect, any single aspect of the
character’s emotional or moral self.
Furthermore, each success adds one to the thaumaturge’s
dice pool when making any Social roll against
the target. This aspect of Call the Weakness lasts for
an entire scene",Sins of the Blood,89-91
Dark Thaumaturgy,Path of the Defiler,2,Tainted,"With this power, the defi ler can plant the seed of
doubt and self-loathing in an individual, slowly infecting
the victim with shame and guilt. With a well-timed comment
or action, the thaumaturge can break the victim’s
spirits, rendering him hollow and empty. An artist will
be ashamed of his work, a priest’s faith will falter, and a
prince might lose all confi dence. Once under the spell of
Tainted, the victim becomes an easy tool for the defi ler
to bend to his own ends."," Tainted requires the thaumaturge to fi rst use
Call the Weakness to discern the victim’s most cherished
quality of herself. This can be something tangible like a
prized possession, or an intangible quality, like a Trait,
Ability or even a less quantifi able characteristic. The
player then rolls as normal, and the target can resist with
a Willpower roll (diffi culty equal to the thaumaturge’s
Manipulation + Subterfuge). If the thaumaturge is successful,
the victim must spend a point of Willpower to
use or acknowledge the Trait or quality in question. For
example, an artist will cease to paint, possibly pushing
him into depression, unless he spends a Willpower point
very time he picks up a brush. Likewise, a priest’s sudden
lack of faith might lead him toward sin as his moral
resolve is stretched to the limit.
The duration of Tainted varies, based on the number
of successes the thaumaturge scored.
1 success One scene
2 successes One night
3 successes One week
4 successes One month
5 successes One year",Sins of the Blood,89-91
Dark Thaumaturgy,Path of the Defiler,3,Degradation,"With this power, the defi ler not only taints an
individual’s source of pride, but he can cause drastic
personality changes as well. Once under the effect of
Degradation, the victim becomes a whole new person,
unrecognizable to his friends and family, and governed
by strange obsessions and desires."," Degradation allows the defi ler to change
a target’s Nature. Doing so has the immediate effect of
altering the victim’s personality and how he regains
Willpower. Most infernalists choose a new Nature that
is contradictory to the target’s old one, forcing the target
to debase himself in order to regain Willpower.
Alternatively, with Degradation, the thaumaturge
can infect the victim with a derangement of the defi ler’s
choice.
The number of success rolled determines the duration
of the Degradation.

5 successes One year",Sins of the Blood,89-91
Dark Thaumaturgy,Path of the Defiler,4,Poisoned Soul,"Far more potent than Degradation, Poisoned Soul
removes any moral or ethical inhibitions from an individual.
Without the need to conform to social mores,
victims of Poisoned Soul succumb to their most base
and perverse desires, indulging in rape, murder, torture
and other heinous crimes to provoke any emotional
response at all from herself, much as a Kindred with low
Humanity does. Poisoned Soul, like other Path of the
Defi ler powers, is subtle and insidious, even though the
results seldom are."," The player spends a blood point and rolls
Willpower as normal. The victim may resist with a
Conscience roll (diffi culty equal to the thaumaturge’s
Manipulation + Empathy). If successful, the victim resists.
If the victim fails, every success that the infernalist
scored reduces the victim’s Humanity rating by one.
The effect occurs at the rate of one Humanity point
lost per night.
Furthermore, each night that the victim’s Humanity
rating is affected, he is compelled to perform one sin
according to his new Humanity rating unless he spends
a Willpower point. In addition, the target incurs any
penalties associated with his new, lower, Humanity score.
If reduced to zero, the victim becomes a mindless beast
for as long as Poisoned Soul remains in effect.
Downward Spiral’s duration is based on the number of
successes scored on the thaumaturge’s Willpower roll.

self-loathing and guilt into a physical cancer that
either turns her into a hideous mass of boils and sores
or kills her outright. The effect is disturbing to witness
as the victim’s skin literally erupts with lacerations and
ulcers that ooze a black, malignant ichor."," The thaumaturge must catch the target
engaging in some depraved act (as determined by his
Humanity/Path score). The player then spends a blood
point and rolls Willpower as normal. For each success,
the victim suffers a health level of aggravated damage.
Additionally, the victim cannot heal these wounds for a
number of nights equal to the thaumaturge’s successes.",Sins of the Blood,89-91
Dark Thaumaturgy,Path of the Unspoken,1,Whispers of the Unborn,"The infernalist opens himself to the raw power of
entropy, and for a few seconds, he can hear what can
only be described as the voices of the unborn. 
Immediately, a chorus of childlike voices and screams 
flood the thaumaturge, who can then discern warnings
or glean information from the resulting cacophony."," The player rolls Willpower and spends a
blood point. For each success, the player can decide to
gain an answer to a single question, or receive a premonition
of danger, or a combination of the two.
If used to gain information, the “voices” can articulate
only rough answers of no more than three to fi ve words
(Storytellers are encouraged to be as vague as they wish),
yet they do seem to be omniscient. Storytellers should
also be cryptic, as the unborn have no real reason to care
about the outcome of the living world’s problems.
If used for premonitions, Whispers of the Unborn
lasts for a scene. During this time, the player can subtract
one from the diffi culty of one roll for each success
achieved.",Sins of the Blood,91-93
Dark Thaumaturgy,Path of the Unspoken,2,Scribing the Unknown,"Entering a trance-like state, the thaumaturge can
subconsciously scribe the contents of a written document
— regardless of the language and without needing
to see the original. As long as something is written
down, whether on vellum or as magnetic data on a
hard drive, there is no way of keeping it a secret from
the infernalist."," For the thaumaturge to enter the trance,
he fi rst needs to know the source of the information he
wants to transcribe (the name of the book, author of a
letter or fi le name is often enough) and the player must
spend the blood point and roll Willpower. The copy is
rarely exact, and unless the infernalist has some skill in
forgery, the transcribed material will look nothing like
the original. Even that isn’t enough in some cases, such
as a handwritten version of a computer document.
The number of success determines the accuracy of
the transcript.
1 success Largely incomplete. Many sentences
are missing, and some words are replaced
with others of different meaning;
20 percent accurate to the original
document.
2 successes Vaguely complete; 40 percent accurate.
3 successes Partially complete; 60 percent accurate.
4 successes Mostly complete; 80 percent accurate.

Dark Thaumaturgy,Path of the Unspoken,3,Shadow Thoughs,"This mysterious power allows the thaumaturge to
peer into anyone’s shadow and glean information about
him. As the saying goes, nobody knows one better than
her own shadow."," Evoking this power requires the usual blood
point and Willpower roll. In addition, the thaumaturge
needs to be standing in the shadow of his intended victim.
Any successes achieved on the Willpower roll allow the
thaumaturge to look into the target’s past, enabling him
to witness any actions or thoughts as if the infernalist
was present. She will be unable to affect the outcome
of the events, though.
The number of success determines how far back in

Dark Thaumaturgy,Path of the Unspoken,4,Fragments of the Forgotten,"With Fragments of the Forgotten, the infernalist
can transcribe information even if the source no longer
exists, or was never written down. Entering a similar
state to Scribing the Unknown, the infernalist can write
fragments of the original Book of Nod, paint DaVinci’s
lost masterpieces or pen Shakespeare’s original copies
of his plays.
Because these tattered memories are invariably
incomplete, however, Hell has been known to “fi ll in
the blanks” when it sees fi t. As a result, no information
this power generates should ever be completely trusted.
Then again, if the person the infernalist reveals it to
doesn’t know the source…."," Fragments of the Forgotten works the same
as Scribing the Unknown, except that the thaumaturge
can now transcribe to paper any written document even if
it no longer exists. However, this power is nowhere near
as precise as Scribing the Unknown. Although Fragments
of the Forgotten allows the thaumaturge to transcribe
lost or destroyed documents, the hellish minions who
provide the information ultimately taint the process.
The fi nal document, though close to the original, is also
extremely subjective and not entirely accurate.
The number of successes on the roll determines how
accurate the document is. The Storyteller should conduct
this roll in secret — as the information no longer exists,
even the thaumaturge should have no idea what parts of
it she can trust and what she can’t. Demons misdirect,
occlude and outright lie about such things, even to in
fernalists. Also, Storytellers will obviously have to make
some parts of this information up for themselves.
1 success Occasionally sensible garble; fi ve percent
accurate to original document.
2 successes Partially intelligible; 10 percent accurate.
3 successes Some parts form complete sentences;
15 percent accurate.
4 successes Rambling, but largely cogent; 25 percent
accurate.
5 successes A clever reader can spot the lies by
context; 50 percent accurate.
Alternatively, the thaumaturge can use Fragments of
the Forgotten to write down prophecies or premonitions
about the future. If used in this manner, the prophecy
gives the infernalist a vague impression of what might
happen. The number of successes dictates how clear the
prophecy is. The nature of the premonition is again left
to the Storyteller’s discretion.",Sins of the Blood,91-93
Dark Thaumaturgy,Path of the Unspoken,5,Forsaken,"The few infernalists who have attainted this level
have the power to literally make people and things vanish
from the collective subconscious. Although the thaumaturge
cannot destroy the target physically, he can cause
it to disappear from the mind’s eye. With Forsaken, the
thaumaturge alters people’s perceptions and memories
about someone or something to the point that they seem
to cease to exist without actually doing so."," Forsaken makes it nearly impossible to fi nd,
remember or even see the person or object in question.
In addition to the normal mechanics for casting, the
thaumaturge’s player must spend permanent Willpower
point and suffer a permanent loss of a health level, subsuming
the person’s legacy into a suppurating wound.
Once this power has been invoked, anyone wishing to
interact with the target of Forsaken must fi rst make a
Perception + Occult (diffi culty [5 + 1 for each success
the thaumaturge scored]) to do so. If he succeeds at
this roll, he can interact with the target of Forsaken
as normal (such as have conversations, remember the
subject’s location, etc.) for as many nights as he scored
success on the Perception + Occult roll. Once this time
expires, the fugue of Forsaken returns.
If the thaumaturge uses this power against inanimate
objects such as paintings or sculptures, the objects become
virtually impossible to fi nd, even in plain sight. Books
collect dust on library shelves, overlooked by everyone,
including their owners, or they sit in huge warehouses
never to be read again — or even unwittingly destroyed
as needless junk.
If used against a person, Forsaken blurs people’s
memories and perceptions so that all forget every meeting
with the victim. The victim still exists, and he can act
as normal, but once out of sight, he is forgotten. Even
if the victim manages to remain in sight, he is often
overlooked and ignored. This effect might have obvious
advantages, but they are outweighed by the drawbacks.
While the prince’s ghoul might overlook the target, so
may the bus driver.
Forsaken remains in effect until the thaumaturge is
destroyed, chooses to end the effect or evokes this power
on another target. If the thaumaturge ends the effect,
he rises the next night with his original complement of
health levels. The thaumaturge can evoke Forsaken on
only one target at given time.",Sins of the Blood,91-93
Dark Thaumaturgy,Path of Pestilence,1,Illness,"Although he is still only a student in the Path of
Pestilence, the thaumaturge with this power can make
his victim succumb to symptoms that are common
among many illnesses. With a simple touch, the victim
can suddenly develop a fever, chills, internal bleeding,
stomach cramps, vomiting, nausea and even open sores.
The effects are never long lasting, but they are nonetheless
debilitating and unpleasant to experience.","victim. The player may then roll as normal, while the
victim rolls Stamina + Survival against a target number
equal to the thaumaturge’s Path of Pestilence rating +
3. If the victim scores more success, Illness fails to take
effect. However, if the thaumaturge acquires more successes,
each success subtracts one from one of the victim’s
Physical Attributes or Appearance, at the thaumaturge’s
choice. If any Physical Attribute drops to below zero, the
victim falls unconscious and remains bedridden. This
power can affect vampires, but they can spend a blood
point to nullify the effect of Illness. Each point of blood
used reduces the Attribute penalty by one.
Illness cannot be healed normally, but the victim
recovers a point in each Attribute every four hours.",Sins of the Blood,93-95
Dark Thaumaturgy,Path of Pestilence,2,Infection,"At this stage of understanding, the thaumaturge
can infect a victim’s wounds causing further injury and
even death. With the right incantation, maggots will
burrow deep into fl esh, gangrene will set in and other
complications arise from even the most incidental of
cuts. Among mortals, Infection usually spells a death
sentence — even with modern medical attention."," Evoking the right incantation (and succeeding
at the appropriate Willpower roll as well as
spending blood) allows the thaumaturge to infect a normal
wound. As long as the victim has suffered a wound
recently (whether bashing, lethal or aggravated), the
thaumaturge can use Infection to cause an additional
level of aggravated damage per individual wound. Mortals
cannot soak this damage, and only vampires with
Fortitude can try to resist.",Sins of the Blood,93-95
Dark Thaumaturgy,Path of Pestilence,3,Miasma,"A thaumaturge this far advanced in the Path of
Pestilence is usually riddled with countless diseases and
sores allowing him to exhale a noxious gas from his mouth
and pores. The resulting miasma affects all creatures that
breathe, while vampires are blinded by it."," If the player spends the blood point and
succeeds at his Willpower roll, the thaumaturge exhales
a cloud of diseased breath around himself. The cloud lasts
for a number of turns equal to the thaumaturge’s Stamina
rating and expands at a rate of fi ve feet per turn. Players of
characters caught in the miasma must roll Stamina (diffi
culty 6). Those who succeed can do little except move
out of the miasma cloud. If they fail, all diffi culty ratings
increase by one for each success scored on the casting
Willpower roll for the duration of the turn. Furthermore,
for every two successes the thaumaturge rolled, those
affected by Miasma suffer one health level of bashing
damage (round down). This damage can be soaked with
Stamina. Vampires take no damage. Instead, they suffer
the diffi culty penalty if they failed their Stamina roll.",Sins of the Blood,93-95
Dark Thaumaturgy,Path of Pestilence,4,Parasitic Possession,"This strange and unnerving power allows the thaumaturge
to take control of an organism riddled with disease.
As long as the target is currently suffering from a viral or
other infection — even something as innocuous as a common
cold — the infernalist can command the host’s body
as if it were her own. The thaumaturge can use Parasitic
Possession on any visible organism (anything from insects
to large mammals), but is not restricted to living beings.
With this power, the infernalist can literally raise the dead,
animating the parasites inhabiting the carcasses."," Parasitic Possession has a number of distinct
applications, however, all require the standard blood
point and Willpower roll. Commonly, this power allows
the thaumaturge to take control of a victim’s body to
perform an action of his choice. If used in this manner,
each success translates into a single physical action
that the victim must perform. The target can resist by
spending a Willpower point to nullify one forced action.
Dead “hosts” may not spend Willpower to resist,
but Kindred may.
Alternatively, infernalists can use this power to
summon and command pestilential insects and small
vermin. Each success determines the size of the swarm
called. However, the thaumaturge can issue only simple
commands such as attack, eat all food or bite.
1 success One tiny animal (a rat), a few insects
2 successes One small animal (a raccoon), a small
swarm (a one-foot cube)
3 successes One medium-sized animal (a dog or
wolf), a medium swarm (a three-foot
cube)
4 successes One large animal (a horse), a large
swarm (a fi ve-foot cube)
5 successes One massive animal (a bear), a veritable
plague of insects.
For more information on swarms, see pages 304-305
of Vampire: The Masquerade.
Finally, the thaumaturge can animate a single
dead organism, as long as it is a host to insects or other
parasites. Once animated, the thaumaturge can issue a
single, simple command, which the carcass follows until
Parasitic Possession wears off. Successes determine how
long the body remains animated:
1 success One turn
2 successes Five minutes
3 successes One hour
4 successes Three hours
5 successes Until sunrise",Sins of the Blood,93-95
Dark Thaumaturgy,Path of Pestilence,5,Vector,"Mastery of the Path of Pestilence grants the thaumaturge

accompanying agony in a matter of minutes.","Mastery of the Path of Pestilence grants the thaumaturge
the ability to infect a target with any virulent
disease. Once infected, the victim succumbs to the virus
almost instantaneously, exhibiting all the symptoms and
accompanying agony in a matter of minutes.
 Vector is a devastating power. If successful,
the thaumaturge infects his target with a disease of his
choice, which then plagues the victim for a duration
dictated by the infernalist’s Willpower successes. Victims
are allowed a Stamina roll (diffi culty 8) upon contracting
the disease. Should they fail, they succumb to the
accelerated effects of the disease, suffering a number of
health levels of bashing damage equal to the thaumaturge’s
total successes, plus whatever the disease itself
imposes upon the sufferer. For mortals, death is almost
guaranteed with Vector.
The disease imparted by Vector has a supernatural
duration, so it is unaffected by medicine or hospitalization,
but medical science may allow characters to heal
the damage they suffer from it. Healing Disciplines will
abate health levels of damage, but not the disease itself
unless the user of the healing effect knows that Discipline

the Vector.
1 success One night
2 successes One month
3 successes One year
4 successes Seven years
5 successes Permanent
Players of Cainites may add Fortitude to their Stamina
roll. Should their characters fail, they contract the
symptoms of the disease for the duration of Vector, but
instead of losing health levels, they lose blood points.
Finally, there is a chance than witnesses and those
who come in contact with the victim may contract the
disease in question and become carriers. Any living 
being within a 10-foot radius must roll Stamina (diffi culty
6) or contract the disease normally. Such “secondhand”
infections are normal, and they may be healed and
treated as such.",Sins of the Blood,93-95

toiling noise of her ravings. The cacophony of a Dissonant
Miserere persists night after night, planting a seed in the
victim’s mind that sanctuary may only be found by calling
upon a demon of madness, who might remove the babble.
The power acts as a doorway for such a demon, waiting to 
strike when the victim is at his weakest. The victim must beg
for the demon to step through in order for this to happen."," The infernalist must possess a piece of the victim’s
skin, hair, or a nail, and soak it in vitae. The Wyrm’s screaming
mouths enter the victim’s mind, increasing the difficulty of
all Willpower tests and any test requiring concentration by
one point per success rolled (to a maximum of difficulty 9),
and removes a temporary Willpower point from the victim
each night it remains.
The effect is permanent, until the victim receives a
blessing or calls upon a madness demon to relieve him of this
pain. If the latter occurs, the demon — a shrieking creature
without tangible form — will offer the victim a reprieve in
exchange for a service. The nature of this service depends
on how weak-willed the demon believes the victim is at this
point (and is determined by the Storyteller), but typical
requests include the murder of an innocent, the divestment
of all worldly goods, or a sacrifice of vitae to the infernalist.",Tome of Secrets,109-111
Dark Thaumaturgy,Die Herrschaft des Wyrms,4,Feed the Wyrm,"By drinking the blood of his victim, the infernalist creates
a sympathetic link between his demonic masters and the
targeted vampire. This link causes agony, and sometimes
even death, as the infernalist’s magic twists and mutates
the victim’s body. A reprieve is only available if the sufferer
agrees to serve the Wyrm with foul future deeds."," The infernalist must possess a portion (one blood
point) of the victim’s blood, mix his vitae with it, and drink
the concoction. This may form a blood bond, if the blood
is that of another vampire. Once the blood is swallowed, a
successful roll inflicts one level of aggravated damage per
success. This damage may be soaked with Fortitude. The
victim’s body contorts with pain and manifests inhuman
growths, reducing her Appearance rating by two dots. The
Appearance loss is cumulative if this power is used more
than once.
The victim may only recover her Appearance rating by
agreeing to serve the Wyrm. If she does so, an urge demon
of vanity appears in a reflective surface and demands a
sacrifice, the severity of which is determined by how great a
loss of beauty has occurred. Sacrifices may entail ripping the
smile from a newborn’s face, slaying a dozen virgins, or the
victim allowing a Maeljin to permanently inhabit her soul.",Tome of Secrets,109-111
Dark Thaumaturgy,Die Herrschaft des Wyrms,5,House of Maeljin,"According to the Malkavian thaumaturgists who founded
this Path, the Maeljin are among the most powerful and wise
of demons. These incarnations of vice, filth, and immorality
are masters of Banes and extra-dimensional demigods.
House the Maeljin allows the infernalist to play host to one
of the Maeljin, at the expense of a dire sacrifice. The power
benefits for hosting a Maeljin are numerous. The moral toll
it takes is immense."," The infernalist must murder a mortal or vampire with
whom they hold a close relationship. If the victim is a vampire,
the infernalist must perform diablerie on his prey. A successful
roll manifests one of the Maeljin in the body of the infernalist.
Each success determines how long the Maeljin remains:
1 success One scene
2 successes One night
3 successes Two nights
4 successes Four nights
5 successes One week
6 successes+ Permanent (or until removed via a
blessing)
If the Maeljin remains permanently, the vampire runs the
risk of losing all control to the demon inside them. It then
becomes a race to achieve purification before the Maeljin
can exert absolute dominance.
The natures of the various Maeljin differ. As beings of
elemental unholiness, they represent abstract sins, such as
shame, loss, anger, and a multitude of further intangible
concepts. Maeljin all empower their host with six points to
spread among Attributes (no Attribute may gain more than
two), six points to spread among Abilities, and six points
to spread among Disciplines (no Discipline may gain more
than two). The Storyteller decides where these points are
allocated on the character sheet.
As examples of how a possessing Maeljin may empower its
host, a Maeljin of Lust might allocate six points across Social
Attributes, place three points in Performance and another
three in Expression, with two points going to Presence, two
more to Dominate, and the final two on Daimonion. A
Maeljin of Lies may allocate two points to Manipulation, two
to Intelligence, and two to Dexterity, with six points spread
among coercive Abilities. The final six might be allocated
to Obfuscate, Presence, and Chimerstry.
An inhabiting Maeljin allows its host to practice the
powers it has bestowed freely. It wants the host empowered
and terrible. However, occasionally it will attempt to sway
or outright control its host into acting in ways favorable to
its alien agenda. In such cases, the vampire must make an
Instinct/Self-Control roll (difficulty 8) to not act in the way
the Maeljin wishes. The Storyteller determines the Maeljin’s
wishes. It may attempt to exert control once a night.
As the Maeljin approaches the conclusion of its
inhabitation, it seeks to consume the host by driving him
into an act of self-destruction. The Maeljin can only attempt
this once, but to resist throwing himself onto a pyre, greeting
the sun, or walking into a sanctified building, the vampire
must succeed on a Courage roll (difficulty 9). If his coterie
attempts to restrain him, he immediately falls to frenzy. The
Maeljin will depart peacefully if unsuccessful in its attempt
to claim the entire soul of its host.",Tome of Secrets,109-111
